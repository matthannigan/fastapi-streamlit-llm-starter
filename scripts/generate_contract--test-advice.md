### Why add unit tests for the contract generator

- **Prevent regressions**
  - Catch breaks in critical behaviors (signatures, decorators, imports, docstrings, spacing) when refactoring or adding flags.
- **Lock formatting invariants**
  - Ensure stable ordering (docstring → imports → classes → functions), blank-line rules, and docstring indentation don’t drift.
- **Guard against AST edge cases**
  - Positional-only/keyword-only args, defaults, annotations, async defs, nested classes, and decorators all have AST quirks across Python versions.
- **Confidence to evolve**
  - Safer to add features (filters, placeholders, comment capture) and internal refactors with snapshot-backed tests.
- **Executable spec**
  - Tests act as living documentation for what constitutes the “public contract.”
- **Cross-version resilience**
  - If you ever run this on different Python versions, tests expose subtle differences (e.g., ast.unparse output).
- **Faster debugging**
  - Small targeted failures (e.g., “kwonly default missing” or “imports duplicated”) pinpoint issues quickly.

### High-impact tests to add

- **Signature coverage**
  - decorators, async, returns, posonly/kwonly, varargs/kwargs, defaults, annotations.
- **Class/member emission**
  - nested classes, empty classes placeholder, method spacing, filtering (private/dunder).
- **Docstrings**
  - module/class/function, multi-line, indentation alignment.
- **Imports**
  - top-level only, dedup, order preservation, nested import suppression.
- **CLI flags**
  - `--include-private`, `--exclude-dunder`, `--body-placeholder`, `--encoding` behavior.
- **Snapshot tests**
  - Golden-file comparisons for representative modules to lock full output shape.

If you want, I can scaffold a minimal pytest suite with table-driven cases and a couple of golden snapshots to start small and expand as needed.
