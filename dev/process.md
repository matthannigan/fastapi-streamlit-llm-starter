# Development Process with AI Coding Assistants

## Task Lists

```
We're preparing to begin Phase 3 of the PRD located at '/Users/matth/Github/MGH/fastapi-streamlit-llm-starter.worktrees/refactor-cache/dev/taskplans/refactor-cache-infrastructure_PRD.md' following the plan located at '/Users/matth/Github/MGH/fastapi-streamlit-llm-starter.worktrees/refactor-cache/dev/taskplans/refactor-cache-infrastructure_phase3_plan.md'. Create a highly detailed task list with all of the sequential steps needed to achieve all 6 deliverables. Do not include time estimates. Save a copy of the task list to `/Users/matth/Github/MGH/fastapi-streamlit-llm-starter.worktrees/refactor-cache/dev/taskplans/refactor-cache-infrastructure_phase3_tasks.md`
```

## Task List Critique
```
I'm beginning work on Phase 3 of my cache infrastructure refactoring project as described in the attached PRD. Thoroughly review the attached Phase 3 plan and detailed deliverable task list.

Then provide a comprehensive technical critique of only the deliverable task list. Identify any task errors or omissions that could become blockers during development and recommend potential solutions.
```

## Agents Analysis
```
We're preparing to begin Phase X of the PRD located at 'PRD.md' following the plan located at 'phaseX_plan.md'. The following detailed task lists have been established for Phase X: 'phaseX_tasks1-5.md' and 'phaseX_tasks6-10.md'.

Please recommend any new Claude agents that should be created that would improve the development process.

## Revise Task List with Agent Recommendations

## Usage Instructions

1. **Create new agents first**: Run any agent creation commands based on previous recommendations
2. **Run this prompt**: Apply it to update the existing task list files
3. **Review output**: Verify the agent assignments make sense for your specific project context
4. **Iterate if needed**: If new technical requirements emerge, re-run this prompt

This prompt will consistently apply the Hybrid Strategy while preserving all your detailed task planning work and ensuring
optimal agent utilization for phased execution.



## Task Execution via Claude with Agents
```
I'm ready to execute Phase X Deliverable Y as detailed in `tasks.md`. Based on the agent recommendations in the task plan:

1. Please review the recommended agents for this deliverable
2. Determine if the primary recommended agent should handle this work
3. Consider if secondary agents are needed for specific subtasks
4. Use the appropriate agent(s) to execute the deliverable efficiently

Focus on maintaining the sequential development path and quality gates outlined in the Agent Utilization Guide.

As each task and subtask are completed, mark them [X] complete in the original tasks file.

After all tasks for this deliverable are complete, create a local commit with a detailed commit message to save our work and prepare for the next deliverable.
