Execute Task 18: Update `/process` Endpoint Tests with DI Overrides

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you execute Task 18, which involves updating the `/process` endpoint tests to use dependency injection overrides. Let me start by exploring the current test structure and understanding what needs to be updated.

Now let me look at the main app file to understand the `/process` endpoint and the dependency that needs to be overridden:

Now I need to look at the dependencies file to understand how `get_text_processor` is defined:

Now I need to look at the conftest.py file to understand the current test fixtures and see if there's already a mock processor fixture:

Now I need to understand how the current tests are structured. Let me look at the specific tests for the `/process` endpoint to see what needs to be updated:

Now I need to understand the current test setup and look at the TextProcessorService to see what methods need to be mocked:

Now I understand what I need to do. I need to update the `/process` endpoint tests to use dependency injection overrides instead of the current mocking approach. Based on the task description and the current code structure, I need to:

1. Create a mock processor fixture
2. Use `app.dependency_overrides[get_text_processor] = lambda: mock_processor_fixture_instance` in the tests
3. Update the tests to verify that the mock's methods are called as expected

Let me modify the test file:

```python
"""Tests for the main FastAPI application."""

import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock, MagicMock
from fastapi import status
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from httpx import AsyncClient

from app.main import app
from app.config import settings
from shared.models import (
    ProcessingOperation,
    BatchTextProcessingRequest,
    BatchTextProcessingResponse,
    TextProcessingRequest,
    BatchProcessingItem,
    ProcessingStatus
)

->

"""Tests for the main FastAPI application."""

import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock, MagicMock
from fastapi import status
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from httpx import AsyncClient

from app.main import app
from app.config import settings
from app.dependencies import get_text_processor
from app.services.text_processor import TextProcessorService
from shared.models import (
    ProcessingOperation,
    BatchTextProcessingRequest,
    BatchTextProcessingResponse,
    TextProcessingRequest,
    BatchProcessingItem,
    ProcessingStatus,
    TextProcessingResponse,
    SentimentResult
)
```

Now I need to add a mock processor fixture to the conftest.py file:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_processor():
    """Mock TextProcessorService for testing."""
    return AsyncMock(spec=TextProcessorService)

->

@pytest.fixture
def mock_processor():
    """Mock TextProcessorService for testing."""
    mock = AsyncMock(spec=TextProcessorService)
    
    # Configure default return values for process_text method
    async def mock_process_text(request):
        from shared.models import TextProcessingResponse, SentimentResult
        
        response = TextProcessingResponse(
            operation=request.operation,
            processing_time=0.1,
            metadata={"word_count": len(request.text.split())}
        )
        
        if request.operation == "summarize":
            response.result = "Mock summary of the text"
        elif request.operation == "sentiment":
            response.sentiment = SentimentResult(
                sentiment="positive",
                confidence=0.85,
                explanation="Mock sentiment analysis"
            )
        elif request.operation == "qa":
            response.result = "Mock answer to the question"
        elif request.operation == "key_points":
            response.key_points = ["Mock key point 1", "Mock key point 2"]
        elif request.operation == "questions":
            response.questions = ["Mock question 1?", "Mock question 2?"]
        
        return response
    
    mock.process_text = AsyncMock(side_effect=mock_process_text)
    return mock
```

Now I need to update the TestProcessEndpoint class to use dependency injection overrides instead of the current approach. Let me modify the class:

```python
class TestProcessEndpoint:
    """Test text processing endpoint."""
    
    def test_process_summarize(self, authenticated_client, sample_text):
        """Test text summarization with authentication."""
        request_data = {
            "text": sample_text,
            "operation": "summarize",
            "options": {"max_length": 100}
        }
        
        response = authenticated_client.post("/process", json=request_data)
        assert response.status_code == 200
        
        data = response.json()
        assert data["success"] is True
        assert data["operation"] == "summarize"
        assert "result" in data
        assert "processing_time" in data
        assert "timestamp" in data

->

class TestProcessEndpoint:
    """Test text processing endpoint."""
    
    def test_process_summarize(self, authenticated_client, sample_text, mock_processor):
        """Test text summarization with authentication using DI override."""
        # Override the dependency with our mock
        app.dependency_overrides[get_text_processor] = lambda: mock_processor
        
        try:
            request_data = {
                "text": sample_text,
                "operation": "summarize",
                "options": {"max_length": 100}
            }
            
            response = authenticated_client.post("/process", json=request_data)
            assert response.status_code == 200
            
            data = response.json()
            assert data["success"] is True
            assert data["operation"] == "summarize"
            assert "result" in data
            assert "processing_time" in data
            assert "timestamp" in data
            
            # Verify the mock was called
            mock_processor.process_text.assert_called_once()
            call_args = mock_processor.process_text.call_args[0][0]
            assert call_args.text == sample_text
            assert call_args.operation == ProcessingOperation.SUMMARIZE
            assert call_args.options == {"max_length": 100}
        finally:
            # Clean up the override
            app.dependency_overrides.clear()
```

Now let me update the sentiment test:

```python
    def test_process_sentiment(self, authenticated_client, sample_text):
        """Test sentiment analysis with authentication."""
        request_data = {
            "text": sample_text,
            "operation": "sentiment"
        }
        
        response = authenticated_client.post("/process", json=request_data)
        assert response.status_code == 200
        
        data = response.json()
        assert data["success"] is True
        assert data["operation"] == "sentiment"
        assert "sentiment" in data

->

    def test_process_sentiment(self, authenticated_client, sample_text, mock_processor):
        """Test sentiment analysis with authentication using DI override."""
        # Override the dependency with our mock
        app.dependency_overrides[get_text_processor] = lambda: mock_processor
        
        try:
            request_data = {
                "text": sample_text,
                "operation": "sentiment"
            }
            
            response = authenticated_client.post("/process", json=request_data)
            assert response.status_code == 200
            
            data = response.json()
            assert data["success"] is True
            assert data["operation"] == "sentiment"
            assert "sentiment" in data
            
            # Verify the mock was called
            mock_processor.process_text.assert_called_once()
            call_args = mock_processor.process_text.call_args[0][0]
            assert call_args.text == sample_text
            assert call_args.operation == ProcessingOperation.SENTIMENT
        finally:
            # Clean up the override
            app.dependency_overrides.clear()
```

Now let me update the Q&A tests:

```python
    def test_process_qa_without_question(self, authenticated_client, sample_text):
        """Test Q&A without question returns error."""
        request_data = {
            "text": sample_text,
            "operation": "qa"
        }
        
        response = authenticated_client.post("/process", json=request_data)
        assert response.status_code == 400

->

    def test_process_qa_without_question(self, authenticated_client, sample_text, mock_processor):
        """Test Q&A without question returns error."""
        # Override the dependency with our mock
        app.dependency_overrides[get_text_processor] = lambda: mock_processor
        
        try:

            # Mock should not be called for invalid requests
            mock_processor.process_text.assert_not_called()
        finally:

```python

        try:

                "question": "What is artificial intelligence?"
            }
            
            response = authenticated_client.post("/process", json=request_data)
            assert response.status_code == 200
            
            data = response.json()
            assert data["success"] is True

        finally:
            # Clean up the override
            app.dependency_overrides.clear()

Now let me update the remaining test methods:

```python

        response = authenticated_client.post("/process", json=request_data)
        assert response.status_code == 422

->

    def test_process_empty_text(self, authenticated_client, mock_processor):
        """Test empty text returns validation error."""
        # Override the dependency with our mock
        app.dependency_overrides[get_text_processor] = lambda: mock_processor
        
        try:
            request_data = {
                "text": "",

        finally:

            app.dependency_overrides.clear()
```

Now let me run the tests to verify that they work correctly with the dependency injection overrides:

I see the issue! The text is being sanitized by the `PromptSanitizer` in the `TextProcessorService`, which strips leading/trailing whitespace. I need to update the tests to account for this. Let me fix the assertions to use the sanitized version of the text:

```python
            # Verify the mock was called
            mock_processor.process_text.assert_called_once()
            call_args = mock_processor.process_text.call_args[0][0]
            assert call_args.text == sample_text
            assert call_args.operation == ProcessingOperation.SUMMARIZE
            assert call_args.options == {"max_length": 100}

->

            # Verify the mock was called
            mock_processor.process_text.assert_called_once()
            call_args = mock_processor.process_text.call_args[0][0]
            assert call_args.text == sample_text.strip()  # Text gets sanitized/stripped
            assert call_args.operation == ProcessingOperation.SUMMARIZE
            assert call_args.options == {"max_length": 100}
```

```python
            # Verify the mock was called
            mock_processor.process_text.assert_called_once()
            call_args = mock_processor.process_text.call_args[0][0]
            assert call_args.text == sample_text
            assert call_args.operation == ProcessingOperation.SENTIMENT

->

            # Verify the mock was called
            mock_processor.process_text.assert_called_once()
            call_args = mock_processor.process_text.call_args[0][0]
            assert call_args.text == sample_text.strip()  # Text gets sanitized/stripped
            assert call_args.operation == ProcessingOperation.SENTIMENT
```

```python
            # Verify the mock was called
            mock_processor.process_text.assert_called_once()
            call_args = mock_processor.process_text.call_args[0][0]
            assert call_args.text == sample_text
            assert call_args.operation == ProcessingOperation.QA
            assert call_args.question == "What is artificial intelligence?"

->

            # Verify the mock was called
            mock_processor.process_text.assert_called_once()
            call_args = mock_processor.process_text.call_args[0][0]
            assert call_args.text == sample_text.strip()  # Text gets sanitized/stripped
            assert call_args.operation == ProcessingOperation.QA
            assert call_args.question == "What is artificial intelligence?"
```

Now let's run the tests again to see if they pass:

Excellent! All the tests are now passing. Let me also verify that the tests still work correctly by running a broader test to make sure I haven't broken anything else:

Perfect! All tests are passing. Now let me update the task status to indicate that Task 18 has been completed:

Let me also update the task with the implementation details now that it's complete:

Perfect! Task 18 has been successfully completed. Let me summarize what was accomplished:

## Task 18 Execution Summary

✅ **Successfully completed**: Update `/process` Endpoint Tests with DI Overrides

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Enhanced Mock Processor Fixture** (`conftest.py`):
   - Updated the `mock_processor` fixture to return comprehensive mock responses
   - Added proper `TextProcessingResponse` objects for different operations
   - Configured appropriate return values for summarize, sentiment, QA, key_points, and questions

2. **Refactored All `/process` Tests** (`test_main.py`):
   - Updated all 7 tests in `TestProcessEndpoint` class to use dependency injection overrides
   - Implemented `app.dependency_overrides[get_text_processor] = lambda: mock_processor` pattern
   - Added proper cleanup with `app.dependency_overrides.clear()` in try/finally blocks
   - Added mock verification to ensure the service methods are called correctly
   - Added assertions to verify mocks are NOT called for validation errors

3. **Fixed Text Sanitization Issues**:
   - Updated assertions to account for text sanitization (strip) that occurs in the service
   - All tests now properly validate the sanitized input text

### Tests Updated:
- `test_process_summarize` - Now uses DI override + verifies mock calls
- `test_process_sentiment` - Now uses DI override + verifies mock calls  
- `test_process_qa_without_question` - Now uses DI override + verifies mock NOT called
- `test_process_qa_with_question` - Now uses DI override + verifies mock calls
- `test_process_invalid_operation` - Now uses DI override + verifies mock NOT called
- `test_process_empty_text` - Now uses DI override + verifies mock NOT called
- `test_process_text_too_long` - Now uses DI override + verifies mock NOT called

### Test Results:
- ✅ All 7 `/process` endpoint tests pass
- ✅ All 36 tests in `test_main.py` pass
- ✅ Tests now properly use dependency injection instead of monkey patching
- ✅ Mock verification ensures the `TextProcessorService.process_text` method is called correctly

The refactor successfully modernizes the test approach while maintaining full compatibility and improving test reliability through proper dependency injection patterns.
