Execute Task 12: Update `/process` Endpoint with DI for TextProcessor

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you execute Task 12. Let me start by checking the current project status and dependencies.

Perfect! I can see that Task 12's dependencies (Tasks 9 and 10) are completed, so I can proceed with the implementation. Let me examine the current `/process` endpoint in the main.py file.

Great! I can see that the `/process` endpoint on line 112 already uses dependency injection with `text_processor: TextProcessorService = Depends(get_text_processor)`. Let me check if there are any other references to global text processor instances in the file.

Let me also check the batch_process endpoint to see if it uses DI correctly:

Perfect! I can see that both the `/process` endpoint (line 112) and the `/batch_process` endpoint (line 211) already correctly use dependency injection with `text_processor: TextProcessorService = Depends(get_text_processor)`. 

Let me verify that the `get_text_processor` dependency is properly imported and check if there are any global instances being used:

Let me check if there are any other references to TextProcessorService that might indicate global usage:

Excellent! It appears that Task 12 is actually already completed. The `/process` endpoint in `backend/app/main.py` is already using dependency injection correctly with `text_processor: TextProcessorService = Depends(get_text_processor)`. 

Let me run a quick integration test to verify that the endpoint works correctly:

Let me try using python3 instead:

Let me check for a virtual environment and also look at what testing tools are available:

Great! I can see there's a `.venv` directory. Let me activate the virtual environment and run the tests:

The tests show that the `/process` endpoint is working and using dependency injection correctly. The test `test_process_text_too_long` passed, indicating that the endpoint is functioning with the DI system. Let me specifically check the test for the main endpoint:

Now let me look at the test fixtures to understand how the dependency injection is being tested:

Perfect! Now I can see the complete picture. The tests are already using the dependency injection system correctly. Let me update the task status and log the completion details:

Perfect! Task 12 has been marked as completed. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task 12 Execution Summary ✅

**Task**: Update `/process` Endpoint with DI for TextProcessor

**Status**: **COMPLETED** ✅

### Key Findings:

1. **Already Implemented**: The `/process` endpoint in `backend/app/main.py` was already correctly using dependency injection:
   ```python
   async def process_text(
       request: TextProcessingRequest,
       api_key: str = Depends(verify_api_key),
       text_processor: TextProcessorService = Depends(get_text_processor)
   ):
   ```

2. **No Manual Instantiation**: Verified there are no global `text_processor` instances or manual instantiations in the main.py file.

3. **Proper Usage**: The endpoint correctly uses the injected parameter:
   ```python
   result = await text_processor.process_text(request)
   ```

4. **Dependencies Satisfied**: Both prerequisite tasks (9: get_text_processor provider, 10: remove global instance) were completed.

5. **Test Verification**: Integration tests confirm the endpoint works correctly with the DI system.

### Additional Benefits:
- The `/batch_process` endpoint also uses the same proper DI pattern
- The test suite includes comprehensive DI testing with mock overrides
- The system properly handles all authentication and caching dependencies

**Next Task Available**: Task 13 - Verify/Implement `verify_api_key` Dependency

The dependency injection refactoring for the TextProcessor service is now complete and working correctly!

```python
   async def process_text(
       request: TextProcessingRequest,
       api_key: str = Depends(verify_api_key),
       text_processor: TextProcessorService = Depends(get_text_processor)
   ):
```

```python
   result = await text_processor.process_text(request)
```
