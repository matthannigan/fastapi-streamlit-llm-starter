Execute Task 16: Refactor Additional Endpoint for `AIResponseCache` DI

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you execute Task 16. Let me first check the dependencies and understand what was identified in Task 14, then refactor an additional endpoint to use dependency injection for `AIResponseCache`.

Now let me check the current status of the dependencies:

Perfect! All dependencies are complete. Now let me examine the codebase to identify which endpoints still use `AIResponseCache` directly, since Task 14 was completed but I need to see what endpoints were identified.

Now let me check the main.py file to see the current state of the endpoints:

Now let me check if there are any other files that might have endpoints using `AIResponseCache` directly:

Let me search for any other files that might contain FastAPI endpoints:

Excellent! I found that there are resilience endpoints in `resilience_endpoints.py`. Let me examine this file to see if any of them use `AIResponseCache` directly:

Now let me check if there are any other services or modules that might need the AIResponseCache:

Let me also check if there are any other Python files that might contain API endpoints or route handlers:

Based on my analysis, I can see that:

1. **All dependencies are complete** (Tasks 5, 6, and 14 are done)
2. **Current state**: The main endpoints in `main.py` already properly use DI for `AIResponseCache` in:
   - `/cache/status` endpoint (line 113)
   - `/cache/invalidate` endpoint (line 119)
3. **Resilience endpoints**: None of the resilience endpoints in `resilience_endpoints.py` directly use `AIResponseCache`
4. **Text processor service**: Already uses DI through the `get_text_processor` dependency

However, I notice that in `main.py`, there's still a direct import of `AIResponseCache` on line 21, but looking at the endpoints, they're all already using proper DI. Let me verify this by looking at whether that import is actually needed:

Perfect! I can see that the import of `AIResponseCache` is being used in the type annotations for the dependency injection parameters in lines 113 and 119. This is actually the correct pattern - the import is needed for type hints.

Looking at the current state:

1. **`/cache/status` endpoint** (line 113): Already using `cache_service: AIResponseCache = Depends(get_cache_service)` ✅
2. **`/cache/invalidate` endpoint** (line 119): Already using `cache_service: AIResponseCache = Depends(get_cache_service)` ✅

It appears that Task 16 has actually already been completed! Both cache-related endpoints in `main.py` are already properly refactored to use dependency injection for `AIResponseCache`. 

Let me update the task status to reflect that the work is already done:

Now let me mark the task as complete:

Perfect! Let me also run a quick verification test to ensure the cache endpoints are working properly with DI:

Excellent! 

## Task 16 Execution Summary

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**

### Analysis Results
Upon thorough examination of the codebase, I discovered that **Task 16 has already been completed** during previous refactoring work. Here's what I found:

### Current State ✅
1. **Cache Status Endpoint** (`/cache/status`, line 113):
   ```python
   async def cache_status(cache_service: AIResponseCache = Depends(get_cache_service)):
   ```

2. **Cache Invalidate Endpoint** (`/cache/invalidate`, line 119):
   ```python
   async def invalidate_cache(pattern: str = "", cache_service: AIResponseCache = Depends(get_cache_service)):
   ```

### Verification Performed
- ✅ **Comprehensive codebase scan**: No other endpoints use `AIResponseCache` directly
- ✅ **Resilience endpoints analysis**: None require cache service refactoring
- ✅ **Import verification**: The `AIResponseCache` import in `main.py` is properly used for type annotations
- ✅ **Dependency structure**: All cache usage flows through the established DI pattern

### Conclusion
The dependency injection refactoring for `AIResponseCache` is **complete across the entire codebase**. Both cache-related endpoints already use the proper `cache_service: AIResponseCache = Depends(get_cache_service)` pattern, fulfilling the requirements of Task 16.

### Task Status Updated
- ✅ Task marked as **DONE**
- ✅ Details updated to reflect the completion status
- ✅ Next task identified as Task 17: "Create `pytest.fixture` for `mock_processor`"

The DI architecture is working correctly and no additional refactoring was needed!

```python
   async def cache_status(cache_service: AIResponseCache = Depends(get_cache_service)):
```

```python
   async def invalidate_cache(pattern: str = "", cache_service: AIResponseCache = Depends(get_cache_service)):
```
