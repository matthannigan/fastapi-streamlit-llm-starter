Thoroughly review the PRD and tasks list. To what degree have the requirements been satisfied and tasks completed?

I'll thoroughly review the PRD and tasks to assess implementation status. Let me examine the current codebase to see what security measures have been implemented.

Now let me check if there are any tests specifically for prompt injection attack scenarios mentioned in the PRD:

Now let me check if there are security-related directories that might have been missed:

Let me also check if the PromptSanitizer or related secure classes exist:

Now let me examine the current validation logic in the text processor:

## Assessment: Prompt Injection Security Implementation Status

Based on my thorough review of the codebase and comparison with the PRD requirements and task list, here's the current implementation status:

### ✅ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED** Security Measures:

**1. Basic Input Sanitization (Tasks 1-2 partially satisfied)**
- ✅ A `sanitize_input()` function exists in `backend/app/utils/sanitization.py`
- ✅ Basic character removal pattern: `[<>{}\[\];|`\'"]`
- ✅ Length truncation to 1024 characters
- ❌ **Missing**: The full `PromptSanitizer` class as specified in the PRD
- ❌ **Missing**: Regex patterns for detecting prompt injection attacks (`ignore previous instructions`, `new instruction`, etc.)

**2. Prompt Structure Improvements (Task 4-5 partially satisfied)**
- ✅ User content is wrapped with delimiters (`---USER TEXT START---`/`---USER TEXT END---`)
- ✅ System instructions are separated from user content
- ❌ **Missing**: The structured `create_safe_prompt()` function with templates
- ❌ **Missing**: The `escape_user_input()` utility function

**3. Basic Output Validation (Tasks 6-7 partially satisfied)**
- ✅ A `_validate_ai_output()` method exists in `TextProcessorService`
- ✅ Checks for system instruction leakage
- ✅ Checks for verbatim input regurgitation
- ✅ Detects AI refusal/error phrases
- ❌ **Missing**: Dedicated `validate_ai_response()` function as specified
- ❌ **Missing**: Comprehensive forbidden response patterns from PRD

**4. Context Isolation (Task 8 partially satisfied)**
- ✅ Each AI call appears to be stateless
- ✅ No obvious shared context between requests
- ❌ **Missing**: Explicit session management documentation
- ❌ **Missing**: Logging for request boundaries

**5. Testing Coverage (Task 9 partially satisfied)**
- ✅ Basic sanitization tests exist (`test_sanitization.py`)
- ✅ One prompt injection test exists (`test_qa_with_injection_attempt`)
- ❌ **Missing**: Comprehensive security test suite for all components
- ❌ **Missing**: Tests covering PRD attack scenarios

### ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** Critical Components:

**1. Dedicated Security Classes (Tasks 1-4)**
- ❌ `PromptSanitizer` class with forbidden patterns detection
- ❌ `prompt_builder.py` with structured templates
- ❌ `response_validator.py` with comprehensive validation
- ❌ Security directory structure (`backend/app/security/`)

**2. Advanced Prompt Injection Detection**
- ❌ Pattern matching for: `"ignore.*previous.*instructions"`, `"new.*instruction"`, `"system.*prompt"`, `"reveal.*secret"`
- ❌ Pre-compiled regex patterns for efficiency
- ❌ Comprehensive forbidden pattern list from PRD

**3. Complete Security Review (Task 10)**
- ❌ Focused security review documentation
- ❌ Manual testing with PRD attack scenarios
- ❌ Security logging implementation

### **Vulnerability Assessment:**

**Current Status**: **PARTIALLY VULNERABLE**

The original vulnerability from the PRD (`f"Please provide a concise summary... Text: {text}..."`) has been **largely mitigated** but **not completely secured**:

- ✅ Direct string interpolation replaced with structured prompts
- ✅ Basic input sanitization applied
- ✅ User content isolated with delimiters
- ❌ Advanced injection patterns still possible
- ❌ No comprehensive validation against sophisticated attacks

### **Implementation Score: 40-50%**

**What's Working Well:**
- Basic sanitization infrastructure is in place
- Prompt structure improvements provide reasonable protection
- Some output validation exists
- Input/output flow has been refactored to use sanitization

**Critical Gaps:**
- Missing comprehensive pattern detection for prompt injection
- No dedicated security module architecture
- Incomplete test coverage for security scenarios
- Missing advanced validation mechanisms

**Recommendation**: Continue implementation focusing on the missing `PromptSanitizer` class with comprehensive forbidden patterns, complete the security testing suite, and conduct manual testing with the PRD attack scenarios.
