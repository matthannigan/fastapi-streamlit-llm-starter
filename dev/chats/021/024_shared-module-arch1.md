Implement Task 1 using task-master

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you implement Task 1 using task-master. Let me first check what tasks are currently in the project and get the details of Task 1.

Now let me get the detailed information for Task 1 to understand exactly what needs to be implemented:

Now let me examine the current structure of the `shared/` directory to understand what needs to be moved:

Perfect! Now I understand what needs to be done. Task 1 requires restructuring the `shared/` directory by creating a new `shared/shared/` subdirectory and moving the existing content into it. Let me set this task as in-progress and then implement it:

Now let me implement the restructuring. I'll need to:

1. Create the new `shared/shared/` subdirectory
2. Move all the existing files from `shared/` to `shared/shared/`
3. Verify the new structure

Let me start by creating the new subdirectory and moving the files:

Now let me move all the existing files from `shared/` to `shared/shared/` (excluding the __pycache__ directory which should be regenerated):

Let me clean up the __pycache__ directory as it will be regenerated:

Now let me verify the new structure by listing both the shared directory and the shared/shared subdirectory:

Perfect! The restructuring is complete. Let me also verify that the files moved correctly by checking the content of one of them:

Excellent! The restructuring has been completed successfully. Let me now mark Task 1 as done and update it with implementation details:

Now let me mark Task 1 as completed:

Perfect! Task 1 has been successfully completed. Let me also generate the task files to ensure everything is properly documented:

## Task 1 Implementation Complete! ✅

I have successfully implemented **Task 1: Restructure `shared/` content into `shared/shared/` subdirectory**. Here's what was accomplished:

### **Changes Made:**
1. **Created** new `shared/shared/` subdirectory
2. **Moved** all existing Python files from `shared/` to `shared/shared/`:
   - `models.py` (7.9KB, 201 lines)
   - `sample_data.py` (14KB, 397 lines) 
   - `examples.py` (12KB, 352 lines)
   - `__init__.py` (33B, 1 lines)
3. **Cleaned up** the old `__pycache__` directory
4. **Verified** the new structure is correct

### **Final Directory Structure:**
```
project_root/shared/
  shared/  # New subdirectory for package code
    models.py      # Moved from original shared/
    sample_data.py # Moved from original shared/
    examples.py    # Moved from original shared/
    __init__.py    # Moved from original shared/
```

### **Next Steps:**
Task 1 is now marked as **done** and has unblocked **Task 2** and **Task 3**, which both depend on this restructuring. The system suggests that **Task 2** ("Create `pyproject.toml` for the `shared` module distribution package") is now ready to be worked on next.

This restructuring creates the proper foundation for the shared module to be packaged as a distributable Python package, enabling the subsequent tasks to create the build configuration and update the import systems throughout the project.

```plaintext
project_root/shared/
  shared/  # New subdirectory for package code
    models.py      # Moved from original shared/
    sample_data.py # Moved from original shared/
    examples.py    # Moved from original shared/
    __init__.py    # Moved from original shared/
```

Implement Task 2

---

**Cursor**

I'll implement Task 2 next. Let me first get the detailed information for Task 2 and then proceed with the implementation.

Perfect! Now let me set Task 2 as in-progress and then implement it:

Now let me first check if there are any existing dependencies in the shared module by examining the Python files to understand what packages might be needed:

Perfect! Now I can see that the shared module uses `pydantic` and `datetime` from the standard library. Based on the imports, I need to add `pydantic>=2.0` as a dependency. Let me create the `pyproject.toml` file:

```plaintext
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "my_project_shared_lib" # Distribution name for pip
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Shared Python code for the project, including models and utilities."
readme = "README.md" # Create a basic README.md in project_root/shared/
requires-python = ">=3.8"
# Add any direct dependencies of the shared code itself
dependencies = [
  "pydantic>=2.0"
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = ["pytest"]

# This configuration tells setuptools to look for packages
# in the current directory (i.e., 'project_root/shared/').
# It will find the 'shared' subdirectory (structured in Task 1)
# as a top-level package. This allows imports like 'from shared.models import ...'
[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
where = ["."] # Search for package directories within project_root/shared/
include = ["shared*"] # This will find the 'project_root/shared/shared/' directory as the 'shared' package.
exclude = []
namespaces = false
```

Now let me create the placeholder README.md file in the shared directory:

```markdown
# Shared Module

This package contains shared Python code for the project, including:

## Features

- **Models**: Pydantic models for data validation and serialization
- **Sample Data**: Standardized sample data for consistent examples across the codebase
- **Examples**: Demonstration code showing how to use the various models

## Installation

This package is designed to be installed in editable mode from the project's backend and frontend environments:

```bash
pip install -e ../shared
```

## Usage

```python
from shared.models import TextProcessingRequest, ProcessingOperation
from shared.sample_data import get_sample_text

# Create a processing request
request = TextProcessingRequest(
    text=get_sample_text("ai_technology"),
    operation=ProcessingOperation.SUMMARIZE
)
```

## Dependencies

- Python >=3.8
- Pydantic >=2.0

## Development

To install development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```
```

Now let me test the package configuration by attempting to build it. First, let me check if the `build` module is available or install it:

Let me install the build module and then test the package build:

Now let me test the package build to validate the pyproject.toml configuration:

I need to install setuptools first. Let me install the required build dependencies:

Now let me try building the package again:

Excellent! The package build was successful. Let me verify that the dist directory was created and contains the wheel and sdist files:

Let me also build the source distribution to ensure complete functionality:

Perfect! Let me verify that both the wheel and sdist files are now present:

Excellent! Now let me return to the project root and update Task 2 with the implementation details:

Now let me update Task 2 with the implementation details and mark it as completed:

Now let me mark Task 2 as completed:

Perfect! Let me also regenerate the task files to keep everything up to date:

## Task 2 Implementation Complete! ✅

I have successfully implemented **Task 2: Create `pyproject.toml` for the `shared` module distribution package**. Here's what was accomplished:

### **Files Created:**

1. **`shared/pyproject.toml`** - Package configuration with:
   - Build system using setuptools>=61.0 and wheel
   - Project metadata with distribution name "my_project_shared_lib"
   - Version 0.1.0 with proper Python requirement (>=3.8)
   - Dependencies including "pydantic>=2.0" (required by the shared models)
   - Development dependencies with pytest
   - Package discovery configuration targeting `shared/shared/` directory

2. **`shared/README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation with:
   - Package overview and features
   - Installation instructions for editable mode
   - Usage examples showing proper imports
   - Development setup instructions

### **Validation Completed:**

✅ **Successful package builds:**
- Wheel package: `my_project_shared_lib-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` (11.7KB)
- Source distribution: `my_project_shared_lib-0.1.0.tar.gz` (10.1KB)

✅ **Package structure validated:**
- Proper dependency handling (pydantic>=2.0)
- Correct package discovery for imports like `from shared.models import ...`
- Build process confirms setuptools can find the `shared/shared/` package correctly

### **Next Steps:**
Task 2 is now marked as **done** and has unblocked **Task 4** and **Task 5**, which depend on this package configuration. The system suggests that **Task 3** ("Add/Ensure `__init__.py` files in `shared/shared/` and its subdirectories") is now ready to be worked on next.

The `pyproject.toml` configuration enables the shared module to be installed as a proper Python package in editable mode, which will allow the backend and frontend to import it using standard Python imports rather than path manipulation.
