@patch('app.services.text_processor.ai_cache.cache_response')
def test_process_with_cache_hit(self, mock_cache_store, mock_cache_get, authenticated_client, sample_text):
```

Looking at the task documentation and the test file, I can see the issue. The tests are trying to mock a global `ai_cache` instance that no longer exists since the codebase was refactored to use dependency injection. Let me fix these broken test mocks.

Now I can see the exact broken tests. Let me check how the dependency injection works to understand the proper way to mock the cache service.

Perfect! Now I understand how the dependency injection works. The cache service gets injected into the text processor service, and the text processor uses `self.cache_service` internally. Let me also check how the existing working cache tests mock the dependencies to follow the same pattern.

Looking at the existing tests, I can see they use `app.dependency_overrides` to properly mock dependencies. Let me fix the broken tests by replacing the non-existent `ai_cache` mocks with proper dependency injection mocking.

```python

    """Test cache integration with processing endpoints."""

            }
            
            response = authenticated_client.post("/process", json=request_data)
            assert response.status_code == 200

        finally:
            # Clean up the override
            app.dependency_overrides.clear()
```

Now let me run the tests to verify that the fixes work correctly:

I see there's an issue with the test fixture. Let me check the structure of the text processor module first to understand the correct path:

I see the issue. The text processor has an `agent` attribute as `self.agent`, not a global instance. Let me check the test fixture to understand the correct mock path:

I see the issue! The mock is trying to patch `'app.services.text_processor.text_processor.agent'` but the correct path should be based on how the TextProcessorService is used. Let me check how the text processor is used in the main application to understand the correct mock path.

Now I understand the issue. The text processor service is injected via dependency injection, and the agent is accessed as `self.agent` on the TextProcessorService instance. The mock needs to target the actual instance that gets created by the dependency. Let me fix the conftest.py file:

```python
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)

Now let's run the cache integration tests to see if they work correctly:

Great! The first test is now working. Let's run the second test:

Excellent! Both tests are now working. Let's run the entire TestCacheIntegration class to make sure all tests in that class are working:

Perfect! All cache integration tests are now working. Let's also run a broader test to make sure we didn't break anything else:

I see there are two other tests that are failing due to a similar mock issue. Let me check the batch processing tests that are failing:

I can see the issue. The batch processing tests are trying to mock `app.main.text_processor.process_batch`, but there is no `text_processor` object in the `app.main` module. The text processor service is injected via dependency injection. Let me fix these tests by using the dependency override pattern instead:

                "batch_id": "test_service_exception"
            }
            response = authenticated_client.post("/batch_process", json=payload)
            
            assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
            # FastAPI HTTPException returns "detail" field, not "error"
            assert "internal server error" in response.json()["detail"].lower()
        finally:
            # Clean up the override
            app.dependency_overrides.clear()
```

Now let's run the batch processing tests to see if they're fixed:

Great! Let's test the second batch processing test:

Excellent! Both fixed tests are now working. Let's run the complete test suite to make sure everything is working correctly:

Perfect! All tests are now passing. Now let me update the task to mark that these broken tests have been fixed:

Now let me mark this subtask as completed since we've successfully fixed all the broken tests:

Let me also check if we should mark the parent task as done since all subtasks appear to be completed:

Perfect! All subtasks for Task 6 are now completed. Let me mark the parent task as done:

## Summary

I have successfully fixed all the broken tests that were mentioned in the task documentation. Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ **Problems Fixed:**

1. **Cache Integration Tests** (`TestCacheIntegration`):
   - **Issue**: Tests were using `@patch('app.services.text_processor.ai_cache.get_cached_response')` to mock a non-existent global `ai_cache` instance
   - **Solution**: Replaced with proper dependency injection mocking using `app.dependency_overrides[get_cache_service]` pattern
   - **Tests Fixed**: `test_process_with_cache_miss` and `test_process_with_cache_hit`

2. **Batch Processing Tests** (`TestBatchProcessEndpoint`):
   - **Issue**: Tests were using `@patch('app.main.text_processor.process_batch')` to mock a non-existent `text_processor` object in the main module
   - **Solution**: Replaced with proper dependency injection mocking using `app.dependency_overrides[get_text_processor_service]` pattern
   - **Tests Fixed**: `test_batch_process_success` and `test_batch_process_service_exception`

3. **AI Agent Mock Fix** (`conftest.py`):
   - **Issue**: Mock was trying to patch `'app.services.text_processor.text_processor.agent'` which doesn't exist
   - **Solution**: Updated to mock the `Agent` class constructor with `@patch('app.services.text_processor.Agent')`
   - **Result**: All TextProcessorService instances now properly receive the mocked agent

### ✅ **Test Results:**
- **All 36 tests** in `test_main.py` now **pass successfully** ✅
- Cache integration tests work correctly with proper mock isolation
- Batch processing tests work correctly with proper dependency mocking
- All existing tests continue to work as expected

### 🎯 **Key Learning:**
The refactoring from global instances to dependency injection requires corresponding updates to test mocks. Instead of mocking global objects directly, we need to mock the dependency injection functions using FastAPI's `app.dependency_overrides` pattern, which provides proper isolation and follows the application's architecture.

### ✅ **Task Completion:**
- Subtask 6.5 has been marked as **done**
- Parent Task 6 "Remove Global `ai_cache` Instance" has been marked as **done**
- All related subtasks are now complete

The broken tests have been completely resolved and the codebase now properly uses dependency injection throughout with appropriate test mocking patterns.
