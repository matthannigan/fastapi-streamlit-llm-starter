Execute Task 6.4

**Cursor**

I'll execute Task 6.4: "Update API endpoints to inject the cache service". Let me start by examining the current API endpoints to identify which ones need to be updated to use dependency injection for the cache service.

Now let me look at the main.py file more closely to see all the endpoints:

Now let me check the resilience endpoints file to see all the endpoints there:

Based on my analysis of the API endpoints, I can see that **Task 6.4 is already complete**. Let me verify this by examining the current state of the dependency injection:

Perfect! Now let me update the subtask to reflect that it's already complete:

Now let me mark this subtask as complete since it's already done:

Perfect! I have successfully executed Task 6.4. Here's a summary of what I found:

## Task 6.4 - Update API endpoints to inject the cache service: ✅ COMPLETE

### Analysis Results:

**Task 6.4 was already complete.** The dependency injection for cache services is fully implemented throughout the application:

### ✅ **Main Application Endpoints (`main.py`):**
- `/cache/status` - Uses `cache_service: AIResponseCache = Depends(get_cache_service)`
- `/cache/invalidate` - Uses `cache_service: AIResponseCache = Depends(get_cache_service)`
- `/process` - Uses `text_processor: TextProcessorService = Depends(get_text_processor_service)`
- `/batch_process` - Uses `text_processor: TextProcessorService = Depends(get_text_processor_service)`

### ✅ **Resilience Endpoints (`resilience_endpoints.py`):**
- `/resilience/health` - Uses `text_processor: TextProcessorService = Depends(get_text_processor_service)`
- All other resilience endpoints either use direct service access or don't require cache

### ✅ **Dependency Chain Verification:**
- `get_text_processor_service()` properly depends on `get_cache_service()` via `cache_service: AIResponseCache = Depends(get_cache_service)`
- `get_cache_service()` properly creates and configures AIResponseCache instances
- All service functions receive the cache service via dependency injection

### ✅ **No Global Cache Usage:**
- No direct usage of global `ai_cache` found in any active endpoint code
- All cache operations go through the dependency-injected services

The endpoints either:
1. **Directly inject the cache service** using `Depends(get_cache_service)` for cache-specific operations
2. **Inject the text processor service** using `Depends(get_text_processor_service)` which itself depends on the cache service

The dependency injection architecture is fully functional and properly configured. I've marked subtask 6.4 as **done** and logged the detailed analysis findings.
