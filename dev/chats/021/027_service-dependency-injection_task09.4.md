Execute Task 9.4

I'll execute Task 9.4: "Integrate Provider with Dependency Injection System". This involves finding where `TextProcessorService` is currently used and updating those locations to use the new `get_text_processor` dependency provider.

Let me start by searching for current usage of `TextProcessorService` in the codebase.

Now let me check the current implementation in `resilience_endpoints.py` and `main.py` to see how they're currently using the dependency injection:

Now I can see that both `resilience_endpoints.py` and `main.py` are currently using `get_text_processor_service` instead of the new `get_text_processor` provider. I need to update these to use the new provider. Let me also check what's the difference between these two functions:

I can see that we have two similar dependency providers:

1. `get_text_processor` (async, line 69) - the new one we just implemented
2. `get_text_processor_service` (sync, line 87) - the existing one being used

Both do essentially the same thing, but `get_text_processor` is async and the new one we want to use according to the task. Let me update the places where `get_text_processor_service` is used to use `get_text_processor` instead.

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException, status
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional
from datetime import datetime
from app.auth import verify_api_key, optional_verify_api_key
from app.services.resilience import ai_resilience
from app.services.text_processor import TextProcessorService
from app.dependencies import get_text_processor

# Create a router for resilience endpoints
resilience_router = APIRouter(prefix="/resilience", tags=["resilience"])

@resilience_router.get("/health")
async def get_resilience_health(
    api_key: str = Depends(optional_verify_api_key),
    text_processor: TextProcessorService = Depends(get_text_processor)
):
    """
    Get the health status of the resilience service.
    
    Returns information about circuit breaker states and overall health.
    """
// ... existing code ...
```

I notice the apply model also changed a direct call to `get_text_processor_service()` which should be corrected since `get_text_processor` is async. Let me check that part of the file:

I can see the problematic line at line 125 in the `/config` endpoint where it's calling `get_text_processor()` directly. This is incorrect since `get_text_processor` is async and shouldn't be called directly. I need to fix this by properly injecting the dependency:

```python
@resilience_router.get("/config")
async def get_resilience_config(
    api_key: str = Depends(verify_api_key),
    text_processor: TextProcessorService = Depends(get_text_processor)
):
    """
    Get current resilience configuration.
    
    Returns the configuration for all resilience strategies.
    """
    try:
        config_data = {}
        for strategy, config in ai_resilience.configs.items():
            config_data[strategy.value] = {
                "strategy": config.strategy.value,
                "retry_config": {
                    "max_attempts": config.retry_config.max_attempts,
                    "max_delay_seconds": config.retry_config.max_delay_seconds,
                    "exponential_multiplier": config.retry_config.exponential_multiplier,
                    "exponential_min": config.retry_config.exponential_min,
                    "exponential_max": config.retry_config.exponential_max,
                    "jitter": config.retry_config.jitter,
                    "jitter_max": config.retry_config.jitter_max
                },
                "circuit_breaker_config": {
                    "failure_threshold": config.circuit_breaker_config.failure_threshold,
                    "recovery_timeout": config.circuit_breaker_config.recovery_timeout,
                    "half_open_max_calls": config.circuit_breaker_config.half_open_max_calls
                },
                "enable_circuit_breaker": config.enable_circuit_breaker,
                "enable_retry": config.enable_retry
            }
        
        return {
            "strategies": config_data,
            "operation_strategies": text_processor.resilience_strategies
        }
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
            detail=f"Failed to get resilience config: {str(e)}"
        )
```

Now let me update the main.py file to use the new dependency provider:

```python
from app.dependencies import get_settings, get_cache_service, get_text_processor
from app.services.text_processor import TextProcessorService
```

Let me check if there are any other endpoints in main.py that I might have missed:

Great! I can see that there are still some usages in test files. However, for the main production code integration, I've successfully updated both `resilience_endpoints.py` and `main.py` to use the new `get_text_processor` dependency provider. 

Let me verify that the changes are working correctly by running a quick test to see if the imports are working:

Perfect! Now let me update the subtask status to reflect completion and add the implementation details:

Now let me mark this subtask as complete since the integration has been successfully implemented:

Perfect! Task 9.4 has been successfully completed. I have successfully integrated the new `get_text_processor` dependency provider into the FastAPI application's dependency injection system. 

## Summary of Task 9.4 Completion:

âœ… **Successfully integrated `get_text_processor` provider** into all relevant FastAPI routes and services:

### Files Updated:
1. **`backend/app/resilience_endpoints.py`**:
   - Updated import from `get_text_processor_service` to `get_text_processor`
   - Fixed dependency injection in `get_resilience_health` endpoint  
   - Fixed `get_resilience_config` endpoint to properly inject `text_processor` dependency

2. **`backend/app/main.py`**:
   - Updated import from `get_text_processor_service` to `get_text_processor`
   - Updated dependency injection in `/process` endpoint
   - Updated dependency injection in `/batch_process` endpoint

### Integration Points:
The new async `get_text_processor` provider is now properly integrated and used throughout:
- Health monitoring endpoints in resilience router
- Main text processing endpoints 
- Batch processing endpoints
- Resilience configuration endpoints

The integration ensures that all routes requiring `TextProcessorService` now use the new async dependency provider with proper FastAPI dependency injection, maintaining consistency across the application architecture.

**Next task in the sequence would be Task 9.5: "Write and Run Tests for the Provider".**
