Execute Task 19: Create `pytest.fixture` for `mock_cache_service`

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you execute Task 19 by creating a `pytest.fixture` for `mock_cache_service`. Let me first explore the codebase to understand the current test structure and the `AIResponseCache` service.

Now I have a clear understanding of the codebase. I can see that:

1. There's already a `mock_cache_service` fixture in `backend/tests/test_text_processor.py` (line 37-45)
2. The existing pattern uses `AsyncMock(spec=AIResponseCache)` 
3. I need to find the best location to add the `mock_cache_service` fixture

Let me check the current mock_cache_service fixture and see if I need to create a new one or if there's already a suitable one in conftest.py:

Perfect! I can see that there's already a `mock_cache_service` fixture in `backend/tests/test_text_processor.py` at lines 39-45. However, the task specifically asks me to create a `pytest.fixture` for `mock_cache_service`, and the task details suggest it should be similar to `mock_processor` and be available globally.

Looking at the existing `mock_processor` fixture in `conftest.py`, I should add a similar `mock_cache_service` fixture there so it's available to all tests, not just those in `test_text_processor.py`.

Let me check the current conftest.py to see if it already has a mock_cache_service:

Perfect! I can see that `conftest.py` doesn't have a `mock_cache_service` fixture yet. I need to add it following the same pattern as the `mock_processor` fixture. I need to import `AIResponseCache` and create the fixture. Let me add this fixture to `conftest.py`:

```python
import pytest
import asyncio
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch, Mock
from httpx import AsyncClient
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

from app.main import app
from app.services.text_processor import TextProcessorService
from app.services.cache import AIResponseCache
from shared.models import TextProcessingRequest, ProcessingOperation

// ... existing code ...

@pytest.fixture
def mock_processor():
    """Mock TextProcessorService for testing."""
    mock = AsyncMock(spec=TextProcessorService)
    
    # Configure default return values for process_text method
    async def mock_process_text(request):
        from shared.models import TextProcessingResponse, SentimentResult
        
        response = TextProcessingResponse(
            operation=request.operation,
            processing_time=0.1,
            metadata={"word_count": len(request.text.split())}
        )
        
        if request.operation == "summarize":
            response.result = "Mock summary of the text"
        elif request.operation == "sentiment":
            response.sentiment = SentimentResult(
                sentiment="positive",
                confidence=0.85,
                explanation="Mock sentiment analysis"
            )
        elif request.operation == "qa":
            response.result = "Mock answer to the question"
        elif request.operation == "key_points":
            response.key_points = ["Mock key point 1", "Mock key point 2"]
        elif request.operation == "questions":
            response.questions = ["Mock question 1?", "Mock question 2?"]
        
        return response
    
    mock.process_text = AsyncMock(side_effect=mock_process_text)
    return mock

@pytest.fixture
def mock_cache_service():
    """Mock AIResponseCache for testing."""
    mock_cache = AsyncMock(spec=AIResponseCache)
    # if connect is async and called by provider, mock it as async
    mock_cache.connect = AsyncMock() 
    mock_cache.get_cached_response = AsyncMock(return_value=None)
    mock_cache.cache_response = AsyncMock()
    mock_cache.invalidate_pattern = AsyncMock()
    mock_cache.get_cache_stats = AsyncMock(return_value={"status": "connected", "keys": 0})
    return mock_cache

// ... existing code ...
```

Great! Now let me create a simple test to verify that the `mock_cache_service` fixture works correctly. Let me create a test file to verify the fixture functionality:

```python
"""Test to verify mock_cache_service fixture functionality."""

import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock
from app.services.cache import AIResponseCache


def test_mock_cache_service_fixture(mock_cache_service):
    """Test that the mock_cache_service fixture returns a proper async mock."""
    # Verify it's an AsyncMock instance
    assert isinstance(mock_cache_service, AsyncMock)
    
    # Verify it has the AIResponseCache spec
    assert mock_cache_service._spec_class == AIResponseCache
    
    # Verify it has the expected methods from AIResponseCache
    assert hasattr(mock_cache_service, 'connect')
    assert hasattr(mock_cache_service, 'get_cached_response')
    assert hasattr(mock_cache_service, 'cache_response')
    assert hasattr(mock_cache_service, 'invalidate_pattern')
    assert hasattr(mock_cache_service, 'get_cache_stats')
    
    # Verify method calls can be tracked
    mock_cache_service.connect.assert_not_called()
    mock_cache_service.get_cached_response.assert_not_called()
    mock_cache_service.cache_response.assert_not_called()


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_mock_cache_service_async_methods(mock_cache_service):
    """Test that the mock_cache_service async methods work correctly."""
    # Test connect method
    result = await mock_cache_service.connect()
    mock_cache_service.connect.assert_called_once()
    
    # Test get_cached_response method (should return None by default)
    cached_result = await mock_cache_service.get_cached_response(
        "test text", "summarize", {}, None
    )
    assert cached_result is None
    mock_cache_service.get_cached_response.assert_called_once_with(
        "test text", "summarize", {}, None
    )
    
    # Test cache_response method
    await mock_cache_service.cache_response(
        "test text", "summarize", {}, {"result": "test"}, None
    )
    mock_cache_service.cache_response.assert_called_once_with(
        "test text", "summarize", {}, {"result": "test"}, None
    )


def test_mock_cache_service_can_be_configured(mock_cache_service):
    """Test that the mock_cache_service can be configured with return values."""
    # Configure get_cached_response to return a specific value
    expected_response = {
        "result": "Cached test result",
        "cached_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00",
        "cache_hit": True
    }
    mock_cache_service.get_cached_response.return_value = expected_response
    
    # Call the method and verify the return value
    result = mock_cache_service.get_cached_response()
    assert result == expected_response


@pytest.mark.asyncio  
async def test_mock_cache_service_cache_stats(mock_cache_service):
    """Test that get_cache_stats returns the expected default value."""
    stats = await mock_cache_service.get_cache_stats()
    assert stats == {"status": "connected", "keys": 0}
    mock_cache_service.get_cache_stats.assert_called_once()
```

Now let me run the test to verify that the fixture works correctly:

I see the issue - in the test for configuration, I need to await the async call since it's an AsyncMock. Let me fix this test:

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_mock_cache_service_can_be_configured(mock_cache_service):
    """Test that the mock_cache_service can be configured with return values."""
    # Configure get_cached_response to return a specific value
    expected_response = {
        "result": "Cached test result",
        "cached_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00",
        "cache_hit": True
    }
    mock_cache_service.get_cached_response.return_value = expected_response
    
    # Call the method and verify the return value
    result = await mock_cache_service.get_cached_response()
    assert result == expected_response
```

Now let me run the test again to verify it passes:

Excellent! All tests are passing. Now let me run a broader test to make sure I haven't broken any existing tests and that the fixture is available to other tests:

Perfect! Now let me clean up the test file I created since it was just for verification:

Now let me update the task status to mark it as complete:

Perfect! **Task 19 has been completed successfully** ✅

## Summary

I have successfully executed Task 19 by creating a `pytest.fixture` for `mock_cache_service`. Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ **Implementation Details:**

1. **Added the fixture to `backend/tests/conftest.py`**:
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture
   def mock_cache_service():
       """Mock AIResponseCache for testing."""
       mock_cache = AsyncMock(spec=AIResponseCache)
       # if connect is async and called by provider, mock it as async
       mock_cache.connect = AsyncMock() 
       mock_cache.get_cached_response = AsyncMock(return_value=None)
       mock_cache.cache_response = AsyncMock()
       mock_cache.invalidate_pattern = AsyncMock()
       mock_cache.get_cache_stats = AsyncMock(return_value={"status": "connected", "keys": 0})
       return mock_cache
   ```

2. **Added the necessary import**:
   ```python
   from app.services.cache import AIResponseCache
   ```

3. **Followed the same pattern as `mock_processor`**:
   - Used `AsyncMock(spec=AIResponseCache)` to ensure proper typing
   - Mocked all key async methods with appropriate defaults
   - Made it globally available from `conftest.py`

### ✅ **Key Features:**

- **Spec compliance**: Uses `AsyncMock(spec=AIResponseCache)` to ensure it has all the correct methods
- **Async support**: Properly mocks all async methods like `connect()` 
- **Default behaviors**: 
  - `get_cached_response()` returns `None` by default (cache miss)
  - `get_cache_stats()` returns a connected state with 0 keys
  - All methods can be tracked and configured as needed
- **Global availability**: Available to all tests in the `backend/tests/` directory

### ✅ **Testing Verification:**

- Created and ran comprehensive tests to verify the fixture works correctly
- Verified async method behavior
- Confirmed configurability for different test scenarios  
- Ensured existing tests continue to pass

### ✅ **Ready for Next Task:**

The fixture is now available for **Task 20: Update Tests for `AIResponseCache` with DI Overrides**, which will use `app.dependency_overrides[get_cache_service] = lambda: mock_cache_service` to inject this mock into the dependency injection system.

The `mock_cache_service` fixture perfectly matches the task requirements from the task details and follows the established patterns in the codebase! 🎯

```python
   @pytest.fixture
   def mock_cache_service():
       """Mock AIResponseCache for testing."""
       mock_cache = AsyncMock(spec=AIResponseCache)
       # if connect is async and called by provider, mock it as async
       mock_cache.connect = AsyncMock() 
       mock_cache.get_cached_response = AsyncMock(return_value=None)
       mock_cache.cache_response = AsyncMock()
       mock_cache.invalidate_pattern = AsyncMock()
       mock_cache.get_cache_stats = AsyncMock(return_value={"status": "connected", "keys": 0})
       return mock_cache
```

```python
   from app.services.cache import AIResponseCache
```
