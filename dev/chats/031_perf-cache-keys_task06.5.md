## 5. Add error handling and documentation for the metrics endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance the endpoint with proper error handling for cases where the CachePerformanceMonitor might fail and add comprehensive API documentation.
### Details:
Implement try/except blocks to catch potential exceptions from CachePerformanceMonitor. Return appropriate HTTP error codes and messages for different failure scenarios. Add detailed OpenAPI documentation using FastAPI's built-in features (description, summary, response descriptions). Include examples of successful responses in the documentation.
```

I'll execute Task 6.5, which involves adding error handling and documentation for the cache metrics endpoint. Let me first examine the current implementation to see what's already in place.

Let me examine the monitoring service to understand what kind of specific errors might occur when getting performance stats:

Now let me look at the `get_performance_stats` method to understand what exceptions it might raise:

Let me also check if there are any other methods called by `get_performance_stats` that might raise exceptions:

Now let me examine if the dependency injection might fail and check other error scenarios:

Now I have a good understanding of the current implementation and potential error scenarios. Looking at the monitoring router, I can see that the basic error handling is already in place, but it could be enhanced with more specific error handling for different failure scenarios. Let me enhance the error handling and documentation based on what I found:

    Get comprehensive cache performance metrics.
    
    This endpoint retrieves detailed performance statistics from the cache system,
    including:
    
    **Key Generation Metrics:**
    - Average, median, min, and max key generation times
    - Text length statistics for cached content
    - Count of slow operations exceeding performance thresholds
    
    **Cache Operation Metrics:**
    - Hit/miss rates and operation counts
    - Performance timing by operation type (get, set, delete)
    - Identification of slow cache operations
    
    **Compression Statistics:**
    - Compression ratios and efficiency metrics
    - Compression time performance
    - Storage savings achieved through compression
    
    **Memory Usage Information:**
    - Cache memory utilization and entry counts
    - Process memory consumption
    - Memory warning threshold status
    
    **Invalidation Statistics:**
    - Cache invalidation frequency and patterns
    - Invalidation performance metrics
    - Recommendations for optimization
    
    The metrics are collected over the configured retention period (default: 1 hour)
    and provide insights into cache efficiency and performance characteristics.
    Metrics are automatically cleaned up to maintain system performance.
    
    **Performance Considerations:**
    - This endpoint may take longer to respond when computing statistics for large datasets
    - Statistics are computed on-demand and may cause brief CPU spikes
    - Memory usage reporting includes process-level metrics

Now I need to update the task status to mark this subtask as completed, since I've successfully enhanced the error handling and documentation:

Now I'll mark this subtask as completed:

Perfect! I have successfully completed Task 6.5. Let me also check if Task 6 is now complete:

Great! All subtasks for Task 6 are now complete. Let me mark Task 6 as done:

Perfect! I have successfully completed **Task 6.5: Add error handling and documentation for the metrics endpoint**.

## Summary

I enhanced the cache performance metrics endpoint with comprehensive error handling and documentation:

### ✅ **Error Handling Improvements:**
1. **Specific Exception Handling** - Added targeted handling for:
   - `ValueError`/`ZeroDivisionError` for mathematical computation errors
   - `AttributeError` for missing performance monitor methods  
   - Pydantic validation errors for response model issues
   - Dependency injection failures (None performance monitor)

2. **HTTP Status Code Differentiation**:
   - **500 Internal Server Error** for computation failures, monitor unavailable, validation errors
   - **503 Service Unavailable** for temporarily disabled monitoring
   - Proper error message categorization for different failure modes

3. **Enhanced Logging** - Added structured logging at DEBUG and ERROR levels with descriptive context

4. **Data Validation** - Added validation for stats format and performance monitor availability

### ✅ **Documentation Enhancements:**
1. **Comprehensive OpenAPI Response Documentation** with detailed examples for:
   - **200 responses** with complete metric examples
   - **500 responses** with multiple error scenarios  
   - **503 responses** for service unavailable cases

2. **Enhanced Endpoint Description** with clear sections covering all metric types:
   - Key Generation Metrics
   - Cache Operation Metrics  
   - Compression Statistics
   - Memory Usage Information
   - Invalidation Statistics

3. **Performance Considerations** - Added warnings about response delays and CPU usage
4. **Clear Error Documentation** - Explained when each HTTP status code is returned

**Task 6** is now completely finished with all 5 subtasks completed. The monitoring endpoint now provides robust error handling while maintaining excellent API documentation for both successful and error responses.
