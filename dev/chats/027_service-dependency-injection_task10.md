Execute Task 10

**Cursor**

I'll execute Task 10 by removing the global `text_processor` instance from the backend service file. Let me start by examining the current file and then proceed with the implementation.

Now let me check if there's a global instance at the end of the file:

I notice the file doesn't have a global instance at the end. Let me search for any global `text_processor` instances in the entire file or codebase:

It seems like the global instance has already been removed from the backend file, but let me check the current backend/app/services/text_processor.py file one more time to be absolutely sure:

Let me also search for any remaining usages of the global `text_processor` variable in the codebase:

Perfect! It looks like the global `text_processor = TextProcessorService()` instance has already been removed from the backend/app/services/text_processor.py file. All the remaining references are legitimate:

1. Imports of `TextProcessorService` class
2. Function parameters named `text_processor` with dependency injection 
3. Test file patches and mocks
4. Local variable assignments in tests

Let me verify that the application still runs by checking if there are any import errors or missing dependencies:

Let me run a more comprehensive check to ensure there are no remaining direct usages of a global `text_processor` variable:

Excellent! Now let me run a few tests to make sure everything is working correctly:

Let me check what tests are actually available in the dependencies test file:

Let me run a dependency injection test to make sure everything is working:

Perfect! Now let me check if the application can start properly:

Excellent! Now let me update the task status to mark it as complete:

Now let me update the subtask with the completion details:

Since this isn't a subtask, let me update the main task instead:

Perfect! Task 10 has been successfully completed. Let me provide a summary:

## Task 10 Execution Summary

✅ **Task 10: Remove Global `text_processor` Instance - COMPLETED**

### What was accomplished:
1. **Verified the removal**: The global `text_processor = TextProcessorService()` instance had already been removed from `backend/app/services/text_processor.py`
2. **Comprehensive verification**: Performed thorough checks to ensure no remaining direct usages of the global instance
3. **Application testing**: Confirmed the application imports and runs correctly with dependency injection

### Key findings:
- The global instance was already properly removed
- All remaining `text_processor` references in the codebase are legitimate:
  - Import statements for the `TextProcessorService` class
  - Function parameters using dependency injection
  - Test file mocks and patches
  - Local variable assignments in tests

### Testing performed:
- ✅ Import tests for both `TextProcessorService` and `get_text_processor`
- ✅ FastAPI application import verification
- ✅ Dependency injection tests passing
- ✅ No global instance patterns found in current codebase

The task has been marked as **done** and the system is ready for the next task in the dependency injection implementation plan. All text processing now properly uses dependency injection via the `get_text_processor` function as intended.
