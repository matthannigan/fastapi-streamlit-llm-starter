Execute Task 9.3

**Cursor**

I'll execute Task 9.3 by implementing the TextProcessorService instantiation and return statement in the `get_text_processor` function. Let me first examine the current implementation.

Perfect! I can see that the `get_text_processor` function has already been implemented and contains the return statement that instantiates `TextProcessorService(settings=settings, cache=cache)`. The implementation is complete and matches exactly what was required in Task 9.3.

Let me update the task status to mark subtask 9.3 as done:

Perfect! Task 9.3 has been successfully completed. The `get_text_processor` function in `backend/app/dependencies.py` already includes the required implementation that instantiates and returns a `TextProcessorService` using the injected `settings` and `cache` parameters.

The implementation is exactly as specified in the task details:
```python
return TextProcessorService(settings=settings, cache=cache)
```

The function is now complete and ready to be used by other parts of the application that need dependency injection for the `TextProcessorService`. The next subtask (9.4) involves integrating this provider with the dependency injection system in routes or services that require it.

```python
return TextProcessorService(settings=settings, cache=cache)
```
