Execute Task 20: Update Tests for `AIResponseCache` with DI Overrides

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you execute Task 20: Update Tests for `AIResponseCache` with DI Overrides. Let me start by checking the current task status and understanding the codebase structure.

Let me check the status of the dependencies first:

Great! All dependencies are completed (tasks 5, 16, and 19 are all marked as "done"). Now let me search for existing tests that might be mocking `AIResponseCache` globally or using it directly.

Now let me also check for any mocking patterns in the test files:

Let me look for global mocking patterns or dependency overrides that might already exist:

Great! I can see there are already some tests using `dependency_overrides` for `get_cache_service`. Let me examine the current test files to understand the current mocking patterns and what needs to be updated. Let me start by looking at the main test file:

Perfect! I can see that some tests are already using the dependency override pattern with `app.dependency_overrides[get_cache_service] = lambda: mock_cache_service`. Now let me check the test files that are still using the old global mocking patterns. Let me look at `test_dependencies.py` since it seems to have many old patterns:

I can see several tests in `test_dependencies.py` are using the old pattern with `patch('app.dependencies.AIResponseCache')`. Let me also check the `test_text_processor.py` file:

Now let me check the conftest.py file to see the current `mock_cache_service` fixture:

Perfect! Now I can see the current situation. The `mock_cache_service` fixture is already available in `conftest.py`. Now I need to identify the tests that are still using global mocking patterns and update them to use dependency overrides. Let me start by updating the tests in `test_dependencies.py` that use the old `@patch` patterns.

Let me first set the task to "in-progress":

Now let me start updating the tests. Let me first examine the `test_dependencies.py` file more closely to understand the tests that need updating:

I can see that the tests in `test_dependencies.py` are testing the actual dependency provider functions themselves, so they SHOULD be using `patch` to mock `AIResponseCache` since they're unit testing the dependency providers. The current implementation is actually correct for these tests because they're testing the behavior of `get_cache_service` function itself.

However, let me check if there are any integration tests that should be using dependency overrides instead. Let me look for tests that are testing endpoints or services that would benefit from using dependency overrides.

Let me check which tests are actually using AIResponseCache in an integration context that should be updated:

Good! The main integration tests in `test_main.py` are already using dependency overrides. Let me check if there are any tests that are still mocking `AIResponseCache` globally that should be using dependency overrides instead. Let me search for tests that mock `AIResponseCache` directly in integration contexts:

Let me examine the `test_dependency_injection.py` file since it seems most likely to contain integration tests that should use dependency overrides:

I can see that `test_dependency_injection.py` is testing the constructor behavior of `TextProcessorService` and not doing integration testing. These tests are appropriately using direct mocking since they're unit tests.

Let me check if there are any specific endpoint tests that should be updated. Let me look for integration tests that might be testing endpoints with cache functionality but not using dependency overrides:

Let me check for any tests that import TestClient and use it:

Let me check the `test_process_endpoint_auth.py` file to see if it has any cache-related mocking that should be updated:

I can see that `test_process_endpoint_auth.py` is focused on authentication testing and doesn't use cache-related functionality that would need dependency override updates.

Let me check the `security/test_context_isolation.py` file:

I can see that the security tests in `test_context_isolation.py` don't explicitly mock `AIResponseCache` either. They're testing the actual endpoint behavior.

Now let me check if there are any tests that might be missing dependency overrides. Let me look more carefully at the patterns. The main issue seems to be that there might be some integration tests that are using the real cache service when they should be using a mock. 

Let me log my initial assessment and check if there are any tests that should be using dependency overrides but aren't:

I need to use the task ID directly since this isn't a subtask. Let me update the task instead:

Great! The AI has provided a good task breakdown with subtasks. Now let me proceed with subtask 2: identifying other endpoint tests that might need updates. Let me look for any test files that might be testing endpoints but not using dependency overrides for cache.

Let me check some of the test files I haven't examined yet, particularly `test_auth.py` and `test_manual_api.py` since they might test endpoints:

Let me check for any tests in the subdirectories:

Let me check the utils directory:

Let me check the security directory:

Now let me run the test suite to see if there are any tests that might be failing due to cache-related issues or using real cache instances:

Great! The test results show that most tests are passing, and the failures are mostly related to:

1. **Manual API tests** - These are trying to connect to a real server that's not running (expected failures)
2. **Context isolation tests** - Some have issues with `AsyncClient` usage and `TextProcessorService` initialization
3. **One test in text_processor.py** - Has an issue with async mock handling

The important thing is that **all the cache-related tests are passing**, which means the dependency injection is working correctly. Let me examine the failing context isolation tests to see if they need dependency override updates:

I can see the issues in the context isolation tests:

1. **Line 195**: `service1 = TextProcessorService()` - This is calling the constructor without required arguments (settings and cache)
2. **Line 366**: Same issue with `service = TextProcessorService()`
3. **Line 119**: `AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test")` - The `app` parameter syntax is incorrect for the newer httpx version

These tests need to be fixed to use proper dependency injection. Let me fix these issues:

```python

Now I need to fix the AsyncClient usage issue. Let me check the current httpx version and fix the async client usage:

```python
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_concurrent_requests_isolation(self, headers):
        """Test that concurrent requests don't interfere with each other."""

        async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as client:

->

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_concurrent_requests_isolation(self, headers):
        """Test that concurrent requests don't interfere with each other."""

        async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as client:
```

Let me check the exact syntax for the newer httpx version:

```python
        async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as client:

->

        from httpx import ASGITransport
        async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as client:
```

Let me read the specific lines to see the exact format:

Now let me fix both AsyncClient usages:

```python
from httpx import AsyncClient

->

from httpx import AsyncClient, ASGITransport
```

```python
        async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as client:

->

        async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as client:
```

Let me fix them one by one:

```python
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_concurrent_requests_isolation(self, headers):
        """Test that concurrent requests don't interfere with each other."""

        async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as client:

->

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_concurrent_requests_isolation(self, headers):
        """Test that concurrent requests don't interfere with each other."""

        async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as client:
```

```python
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_batch_processing_isolation(self, headers):
        """Test that batch processing maintains isolation between items."""

        async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as client:

->

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_batch_processing_isolation(self, headers):
        """Test that batch processing maintains isolation between items."""

        async with AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app), base_url="http://test") as client:
```

Now let me run the tests again to see if the context isolation tests are fixed:

I'll analyze Task 20 and execute it to update tests that previously mocked `AIResponseCache` globally to use `app.dependency_overrides` with `mock_cache_service`.

Let me check the dependencies to ensure they're completed:

Good! Dependencies 5, 16, and 19 are all completed. Now let me proceed with Task 20. First, let me identify other endpoint tests that might be using real cache instances:

Now let me check the conftest.py file to see the mock_cache_service fixture:

Perfect! I can see that the `mock_cache_service` fixture is already properly defined in `conftest.py` (lines 118-126). Now let me check the current test files to see which ones are using dependency injection properly and which ones might need updates:
