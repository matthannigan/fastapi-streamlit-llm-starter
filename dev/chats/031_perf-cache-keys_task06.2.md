Execute Task 6.2: Implement the cache performance metrics endpoint

**Cursor**

I'll help you implement Task 6.2: the cache performance metrics endpoint. Let me start by exploring the current project structure to understand what's already been set up.

Now let me check the CachePerformanceMonitor to understand what `get_performance_stats()` returns:

Let me see the `get_performance_stats()` method to understand what it returns:

Now let me check if there's a dependency service for the CachePerformanceMonitor to understand how to inject it:

Let me check the dependencies file to see how the cache service is injected:

Now let me check how the cache service is created to see if it has a performance monitor:

Perfect! Now I can see that the cache service has a performance monitor. Let me create a dependency to get the performance monitor from the cache service and implement the endpoint. First, let me create a Pydantic model for the response:

Now let me update the task status to mark this subtask as complete:

Now let me also update the subtask with implementation details:

Perfect! I have successfully implemented Task 6.2: "Implement the cache performance metrics endpoint". Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## ✅ Task 6.2 Complete - Cache Performance Metrics Endpoint

### Key Features Implemented:

1. **Complete Endpoint Implementation**:
   - Created `GET /monitoring/cache-metrics` endpoint in `backend/app/routers/monitoring.py`
   - Integrated with existing monitoring router structure
   - Proper FastAPI routing with tags and documentation

2. **Comprehensive Pydantic Models**:
   - `CachePerformanceResponse` - Main response model
   - `CacheKeyGenerationStats` - Key generation metrics
   - `CacheOperationStats` - Cache operation timing stats
   - `CacheOperationTypeStats` - Operation-specific statistics  
   - `CompressionStats` - Compression efficiency data
   - All models include detailed field descriptions and example data

3. **Proper Dependency Injection**:
   - Created `get_performance_monitor()` dependency function
   - Leverages existing `get_cache_service()` dependency
   - Extracts performance monitor from cache service instance

4. **Error Handling & Documentation**:
   - Try/catch blocks with proper HTTP status codes
   - Comprehensive API documentation with examples
   - Detailed docstrings explaining all returned metrics

5. **Metrics Returned**:
   - Cache hit rates and operation counts
   - Key generation performance statistics
   - Cache operation timing by type
   - Compression efficiency data
   - Memory usage information
   - Cache invalidation statistics

### Next Steps:
The endpoint is now ready for the next subtask (6.4) which involves registering this monitoring router with the main FastAPI application. The endpoint follows FastAPI best practices and is well-documented with proper error handling.

The task status has been updated to "done" and detailed implementation notes have been logged for future reference.
