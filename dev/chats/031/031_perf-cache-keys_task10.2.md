**Cursor**

I'll help you execute Task 10.2: Document Configuration Options in config.py. Let me start by examining the project structure and the current configuration files to understand what caching-related configuration options exist.

Found the config.py file! Let me examine it to understand the caching-related configuration options.

Now let me check the current backend README.md to see how documentation is currently structured and where I should add the configuration documentation.

Let me continue reading the README to see if there's already a configuration section and understand the complete structure.

Great! I can see there's already a "Configuration" section. Let me read the relevant parts of the README to understand the current configuration documentation.

Now let me read the rest of the README to see the complete structure:

Perfect! Now I can see the current structure. I notice there's already a "Configuration Options" section within the caching documentation (around line 302), but it's quite basic. I need to expand this significantly according to the task requirements. The task asks me to document all configuration parameters related to the caching system with default values and usage examples.

Let me create a comprehensive configuration documentation section. I'll replace and expand the existing "Configuration Options" section.

```markdown
#### Configuration Options

**Cache Settings in `config.py`:**

```python
# Redis Configuration
redis_url: str = "redis://redis:6379"

# Key Generation
cache_text_hash_threshold: int = 1000  # Hash threshold for text
cache_text_size_tiers: dict = {
    'small': 500,      # Small text threshold
    'medium': 5000,    # Medium text threshold  
    'large': 50000     # Large text threshold
}

# Memory Cache
cache_memory_cache_size: int = 100  # Max items in memory

# Compression
cache_compression_threshold: int = 1000   # Compression threshold (bytes)
cache_compression_level: int = 6          # Compression level (1-9)

# TTL Settings
cache_default_ttl: int = 3600  # Default TTL (1 hour)
```

**Environment Variables:**
```env
# Redis connection (optional, defaults to redis://redis:6379)
REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-host:6379
```

->

#### Configuration Options

The caching system is highly configurable through the `config.py` file. All settings have sensible defaults and can be customized for different deployment scenarios and performance requirements.

##### Redis Configuration

**`redis_url`** (str)
- **Default:** `"redis://redis:6379"`
- **Description:** Redis connection URL for the distributed cache layer (L2)
- **Range:** Any valid Redis URL format
- **Environment Variable:** `REDIS_URL`
- **Example Usage:**
  ```python
  # For local development
  redis_url = "redis://localhost:6379"
  
  # For production with authentication
  redis_url = "redis://username:password@redis-host:6379/0"
  
  # For Redis Cluster
  redis_url = "redis://cluster-node1:6379,cluster-node2:6379"
  ```

##### Cache Key Generation Settings

**`cache_text_hash_threshold`** (int)
- **Default:** `1000`
- **Description:** Character count threshold for when text content should be hashed in cache keys instead of using full text
- **Range:** > 0 (recommended: 500-2000)
- **Example Usage:**
  ```python
  # Conservative approach - hash smaller texts for security
  cache_text_hash_threshold = 500
  
  # Liberal approach - keep more text readable in keys for debugging
  cache_text_hash_threshold = 2000
  ```

**`cache_text_size_tiers`** (dict)
- **Default:** `{'small': 500, 'medium': 5000, 'large': 50000}`
- **Description:** Text size tiers for caching strategy optimization. Defines character thresholds for different caching approaches
- **Structure:**
  - `small`: Texts cached in memory for fastest access
  - `medium`: Texts cached with optimized key generation
  - `large`: Texts cached with content hashing for efficiency
- **Example Usage:**
  ```python
  # For memory-constrained environments
  cache_text_size_tiers = {
      'small': 200,    # Very small texts only in memory
      'medium': 2000,  # Smaller medium tier
      'large': 20000   # Smaller large tier
  }
  
  # For high-memory environments with large documents
  cache_text_size_tiers = {
      'small': 1000,   # More texts in fast memory cache
      'medium': 10000, # Larger medium tier
      'large': 100000  # Support very large documents
  }
  ```

##### Memory Cache Configuration

**`cache_memory_cache_size`** (int)
- **Default:** `100`
- **Description:** Maximum number of items to store in the in-memory cache (L1) for small texts. Higher values improve hit rates but use more memory
- **Range:** > 0 (recommended: 50-500)
- **Memory Impact:** Each item uses ~1-5KB depending on response size
- **Example Usage:**
  ```python
  # For low-memory environments
  cache_memory_cache_size = 50
  
  # For high-traffic applications with sufficient memory
  cache_memory_cache_size = 500
  
  # For development/testing
  cache_memory_cache_size = 10
  ```

##### Cache Compression Settings

**`cache_compression_threshold`** (int)
- **Default:** `1000`
- **Description:** Size threshold in bytes for when cached responses should be compressed before storage in Redis
- **Range:** > 0 (recommended: 500-5000)
- **Trade-off:** Lower values save storage but increase CPU usage
- **Example Usage:**
  ```python
  # Aggressive compression for storage optimization
  cache_compression_threshold = 500
  
  # Conservative compression for CPU optimization
  cache_compression_threshold = 5000
  
  # Disable compression for small responses
  cache_compression_threshold = 10000
  ```

**`cache_compression_level`** (int)
- **Default:** `6`
- **Description:** Compression level (1-9) where 9 is highest compression but slowest, 1 is fastest but lowest compression
- **Range:** 1-9
- **Recommended:** 4-7 for balanced performance
- **Example Usage:**
  ```python
  # Fast compression for high-throughput systems
  cache_compression_level = 3
  
  # Balanced performance (default)
  cache_compression_level = 6
  
  # Maximum compression for storage-constrained environments
  cache_compression_level = 9
  ```

##### Cache TTL (Time To Live) Settings

**`cache_default_ttl`** (int)
- **Default:** `3600` (1 hour)
- **Description:** Default cache TTL in seconds. Controls how long cached responses remain valid before expiration
- **Range:** > 0 (recommended: 300-86400)
- **Example Usage:**
  ```python
  # Short TTL for frequently changing data
  cache_default_ttl = 600  # 10 minutes
  
  # Standard TTL (default)
  cache_default_ttl = 3600  # 1 hour
  
  # Long TTL for stable content
  cache_default_ttl = 86400  # 24 hours
  
  # Very short TTL for development/testing
  cache_default_ttl = 60  # 1 minute
  ```

##### Environment Variable Overrides

All cache configuration can be overridden using environment variables. The variable names follow the pattern `CACHE_<SETTING_NAME>` in uppercase:

```env
# Redis Configuration
REDIS_URL=redis://production-redis:6379

# Cache Key Generation
CACHE_TEXT_HASH_THRESHOLD=1500

# Memory Cache
CACHE_MEMORY_CACHE_SIZE=200

# Compression Settings
CACHE_COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD=1500
CACHE_COMPRESSION_LEVEL=7

# TTL Settings
CACHE_DEFAULT_TTL=7200
```

##### Configuration Validation

The configuration system includes automatic validation:

- **Type Checking:** All numeric values are validated for correct types
- **Range Validation:** Values are checked against acceptable ranges
- **Dependency Validation:** Related settings are cross-validated for compatibility

##### Performance Tuning Guidelines

**For High-Traffic Applications:**
```python
cache_memory_cache_size = 500          # More memory cache
cache_compression_threshold = 2000     # Selective compression
cache_compression_level = 4            # Fast compression
cache_default_ttl = 7200              # Longer TTL
```

**For Memory-Constrained Environments:**
```python
cache_memory_cache_size = 25           # Minimal memory cache
cache_compression_threshold = 500      # Aggressive compression
cache_compression_level = 8            # High compression
cache_default_ttl = 1800              # Shorter TTL
```

**For Development/Testing:**
```python
cache_memory_cache_size = 10           # Small cache for testing
cache_compression_threshold = 10000    # Minimal compression
cache_compression_level = 1            # Fast compression
cache_default_ttl = 300               # Short TTL for rapid iteration
```
```

Now let me also update the main Configuration section to include the caching-related environment variables and ensure consistency. Let me first check what's currently in the main Configuration section:

I can see the main Configuration section needs to be updated to include the cache-related environment variables. Let me add a Cache Settings subsection to the main Configuration section:
