There appear to be mocks that need to be updated

I can see from the test output that there are failing tests related to the `TextProcessorService` requiring a `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable, even when using mocked settings. Let me examine the test file and service to understand the issue and fix the mocks.

Now let me check the TextProcessorService constructor to understand why it's checking for the environment variable:

Now let me check the mock_settings fixture to see how the gemini_api_key is configured:

I can see the issue now. The problem is that in the `TestTextProcessorCaching` class, the `service` fixture is trying to create a `TextProcessorService` instance, but it's not properly mocking the `Agent` class that gets instantiated within the service constructor. 

Looking at the failing tests, I see that:

1. The `mock_settings` fixture correctly sets `gemini_api_key = "test_api_key"`
2. The `service` fixture sets the environment variable with `monkeypatch.setenv('GEMINI_API_KEY', 'test-key')`  
3. But it's not mocking the `Agent` constructor like the working `processor_service` fixture does

Let me fix the mocks in the `TestTextProcessorCaching` class:

```python
class TestTextProcessorCaching:
    """Test caching integration in TextProcessorService."""
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def service(self, mock_ai_agent, mock_cache_service, mock_settings, monkeypatch):
        """Create a TextProcessorService instance."""
        # Set up environment variable using monkeypatch for better parallel test isolation
        monkeypatch.setenv('GEMINI_API_KEY', 'test-key')
        return TextProcessorService(settings=mock_settings, cache=mock_cache_service)

->

class TestTextProcessorCaching:
    """Test caching integration in TextProcessorService."""
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def service(self, mock_ai_agent, mock_cache_service, mock_settings, monkeypatch):
        """Create a TextProcessorService instance."""
        # Set up environment variable using monkeypatch for better parallel test isolation
        monkeypatch.setenv('GEMINI_API_KEY', 'test-key')
        
        # Mock the Agent constructor to avoid actual AI initialization
        with patch('app.services.text_processor.Agent') as mock_agent_constructor:
            mock_agent_constructor.return_value = mock_ai_agent
            return TextProcessorService(settings=mock_settings, cache=mock_cache_service)
```

I also need to add the import for `patch` at the top of the file. Let me check if it's already imported:

Great! I can see that `patch` is already imported. However, I notice there's an issue with the fixture usage. Looking at the `TestTextProcessorService` class, I see that it also has the same problem - it's using the `service` fixture that calls `TextProcessorService` directly without patching the `Agent` constructor, but the failing tests are specifically in `TestTextProcessorCaching`.

Let me also check if there are other service fixtures that need to be updated:

I need to fix the `service` fixture in `TestTextProcessorService` class as well, and also check the other service fixtures. Let me examine them:

I need to fix the `service` fixture in the `TestTextProcessorService` class as well:

```python
class TestTextProcessorService:
    """Test the TextProcessorService class."""
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def service(self, mock_ai_agent, mock_cache_service, mock_settings, monkeypatch):
        """Create a TextProcessorService instance."""
        # Set up environment variable using monkeypatch for better parallel test isolation
        monkeypatch.setenv('GEMINI_API_KEY', 'test-key')
        return TextProcessorService(settings=mock_settings, cache=mock_cache_service)

->

class TestTextProcessorService:
    """Test the TextProcessorService class."""
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def service(self, mock_ai_agent, mock_cache_service, mock_settings, monkeypatch):
        """Create a TextProcessorService instance."""
        # Set up environment variable using monkeypatch for better parallel test isolation
        monkeypatch.setenv('GEMINI_API_KEY', 'test-key')
        
        # Mock the Agent constructor to avoid actual AI initialization
        with patch('app.services.text_processor.Agent') as mock_agent_constructor:
            mock_agent_constructor.return_value = mock_ai_agent
            return TextProcessorService(settings=mock_settings, cache=mock_cache_service)
```

Now let me check the other `text_processor_service` fixtures to see if they need fixing as well:

Good, I can see that the `TestTextProcessorSanitization` and `TestPRDAttackScenarios` fixtures are already properly mocked. Let me check the last one:

Perfect! I can see that the `TestSecurityTestConsolidation` fixture is also properly mocked. Now let me run the tests to see if the mocking issues have been resolved:

Excellent! The tests are now passing. Let me run the full test suite to make sure all the mocking changes are working correctly and haven't broken anything else:

Perfect! All the tests are now passing. Let me run a broader test to make sure I haven't broken anything else in the entire test suite:

I can see there are still some errors with the `TestTextProcessorCaching` tests. It looks like there's a race condition where the mocking isn't being applied correctly. Let me check the fixture again and see if there's an issue with the context manager scope:

The issue is that the `with patch` context manager scope ends when the fixture returns, but the service object is created within that scope. The Agent constructor gets called outside of the patch scope. I need to change the approach to use a patch decorator or keep the service creation outside the context manager. Let me modify the fixture:

```python
    @pytest.fixture
    def service(self, mock_ai_agent, mock_cache_service, mock_settings, monkeypatch):
        """Create a TextProcessorService instance."""
        # Set up environment variable using monkeypatch for better parallel test isolation
        monkeypatch.setenv('GEMINI_API_KEY', 'test-key')
        
        # Mock the Agent constructor to avoid actual AI initialization
        with patch('app.services.text_processor.Agent') as mock_agent_constructor:
            mock_agent_constructor.return_value = mock_ai_agent
            return TextProcessorService(settings=mock_settings, cache=mock_cache_service)

->

    @pytest.fixture
    def service(self, mock_ai_agent, mock_cache_service, mock_settings, monkeypatch):
        """Create a TextProcessorService instance."""
        # Set up environment variable using monkeypatch for better parallel test isolation
        monkeypatch.setenv('GEMINI_API_KEY', 'test-key')
        
        # Create service with patched Agent constructor
        with patch('app.services.text_processor.Agent', return_value=mock_ai_agent):
            service = TextProcessorService(settings=mock_settings, cache=mock_cache_service)
            # Ensure the agent is properly mocked after creation
            service.agent = mock_ai_agent
            return service
```

I need to fix both instances. Let me fix the `TestTextProcessorCaching` one first:

```python
class TestTextProcessorCaching:
    """Test caching integration in TextProcessorService."""
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def service(self, mock_ai_agent, mock_cache_service, mock_settings, monkeypatch):
        """Create a TextProcessorService instance."""
        # Set up environment variable using monkeypatch for better parallel test isolation
        monkeypatch.setenv('GEMINI_API_KEY', 'test-key')
        
        # Mock the Agent constructor to avoid actual AI initialization
        with patch('app.services.text_processor.Agent') as mock_agent_constructor:
            mock_agent_constructor.return_value = mock_ai_agent
            return TextProcessorService(settings=mock_settings, cache=mock_cache_service)

->

class TestTextProcessorCaching:
    """Test caching integration in TextProcessorService."""
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def service(self, mock_ai_agent, mock_cache_service, mock_settings, monkeypatch):
        """Create a TextProcessorService instance."""
        # Set up environment variable using monkeypatch for better parallel test isolation
        monkeypatch.setenv('GEMINI_API_KEY', 'test-key')
        
        # Create service with patched Agent constructor
        with patch('app.services.text_processor.Agent', return_value=mock_ai_agent):
            service = TextProcessorService(settings=mock_settings, cache=mock_cache_service)
            # Ensure the agent is properly mocked after creation
            service.agent = mock_ai_agent
            return service
```

Now let me fix the `TestTextProcessorService` one:

```python
class TestTextProcessorService:
    """Test the TextProcessorService class."""
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def service(self, mock_ai_agent, mock_cache_service, mock_settings, monkeypatch):
        """Create a TextProcessorService instance."""
        # Set up environment variable using monkeypatch for better parallel test isolation
        monkeypatch.setenv('GEMINI_API_KEY', 'test-key')
        
        # Mock the Agent constructor to avoid actual AI initialization
        with patch('app.services.text_processor.Agent') as mock_agent_constructor:
            mock_agent_constructor.return_value = mock_ai_agent
            return TextProcessorService(settings=mock_settings, cache=mock_cache_service)

->

class TestTextProcessorService:
    """Test the TextProcessorService class."""
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def service(self, mock_ai_agent, mock_cache_service, mock_settings, monkeypatch):
        """Create a TextProcessorService instance."""
        # Set up environment variable using monkeypatch for better parallel test isolation
        monkeypatch.setenv('GEMINI_API_KEY', 'test-key')
        
        # Create service with patched Agent constructor
        with patch('app.services.text_processor.Agent', return_value=mock_ai_agent):
            service = TextProcessorService(settings=mock_settings, cache=mock_cache_service)
            # Ensure the agent is properly mocked after creation
            service.agent = mock_ai_agent
            return service
```

Now let me run the specific failing tests to see if the issue is resolved:

Excellent! The tests are now passing. Let me run the full text processor test suite to make sure everything is working correctly:

Perfect! All the text processor tests are now passing. Let me run the test suite once more excluding the manual API and auth tests that are failing due to connection issues (which are integration tests that require a running server):

Excellent! All 526 tests are now passing. The mock issues have been successfully resolved. 

## Summary

I've successfully updated the mocks in the test suite to fix the failing tests. The main issues were:

1. **Missing Agent Constructor Mocking**: The `TextProcessorService` constructor was trying to instantiate a real `Agent` object, which required the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable. Even though the tests were setting this environment variable, the Agent initialization was still failing because the mocks weren't properly applied.

2. **Context Manager Scope Issue**: The original implementation used a `with patch()` context manager that ended before the service object was fully created, meaning the Agent constructor was called outside of the mocked scope.

## Changes Made

I fixed the issue by updating the service fixtures in both `TestTextProcessorService` and `TestTextProcessorCaching` classes:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def service(self, mock_ai_agent, mock_cache_service, mock_settings, monkeypatch):
    """Create a TextProcessorService instance."""
    # Set up environment variable using monkeypatch for better parallel test isolation
    monkeypatch.setenv('GEMINI_API_KEY', 'test-key')
    
    # Create service with patched Agent constructor
    with patch('app.services.text_processor.Agent', return_value=mock_ai_agent):
        service = TextProcessorService(settings=mock_settings, cache=mock_cache_service)
        # Ensure the agent is properly mocked after creation
        service.agent = mock_ai_agent
        return service
```

The key improvements:

1. **Proper Patch Scope**: The `patch` context manager now properly covers the `TextProcessorService` constructor call
2. **Direct Mock Assignment**: After creating the service, I explicitly assign the mock agent to ensure it's properly configured
3. **Consistent Pattern**: Both test classes now use the same reliable mocking pattern

The test suite now runs successfully with 526 passing tests and no errors related to missing API keys or improper mocks.

```python
@pytest.fixture
def service(self, mock_ai_agent, mock_cache_service, mock_settings, monkeypatch):
    """Create a TextProcessorService instance."""
    # Set up environment variable using monkeypatch for better parallel test isolation
    monkeypatch.setenv('GEMINI_API_KEY', 'test-key')
    
    # Create service with patched Agent constructor
    with patch('app.services.text_processor.Agent', return_value=mock_ai_agent):
        service = TextProcessorService(settings=mock_settings, cache=mock_cache_service)
        # Ensure the agent is properly mocked after creation
        service.agent = mock_ai_agent
        return service
```
