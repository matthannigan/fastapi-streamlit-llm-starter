FAILED tests/test_cache.py::TestMemoryCacheOperations::test_invalidation_integration_with_performance_stats - AssertionError: assert 'total_invalidations' in {'hit_ratio': 0.0, 'total_operations': 0, 'cache_hits': 0, 'cache_misses': 0, 'recent_avg_key_generation_time': 0.0, 'recent_avg_cache_operation_time': 0.0}
```

I can see there's one remaining test failure. The test `test_invalidation_integration_with_performance_stats` is expecting a `total_invalidations` field in the performance summary, but it's not present in the returned dictionary.

Let me examine this failing test to understand what needs to be fixed:

I can see the issue. The test `test_invalidation_integration_with_performance_stats` expects `total_invalidations` and `total_keys_invalidated` to be present in the performance summary, but these fields aren't being included. Let me check what fields are actually being returned in the performance summary:

Now I can see the issue! In the `get_performance_summary` method, the `total_invalidations` field is only included if `self.performance_monitor.total_invalidations > 0`. However, the test is expecting these fields to always be present. Let me also check if there's a `total_keys_invalidated` field in the performance monitor:

Perfect! So `total_keys_invalidated` does exist in the performance monitor. The issue is that the `get_performance_summary` method only includes invalidation stats when `total_invalidations > 0`, but the test expects these fields to always be present. Let me fix this by updating the `get_performance_summary` method to always include these fields:

```python
    def get_performance_summary(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get a summary of cache performance metrics."""
        summary = {
            "hit_ratio": self.get_cache_hit_ratio(),
            "total_operations": self.performance_monitor.total_operations,
            "cache_hits": self.performance_monitor.cache_hits,
            "cache_misses": self.performance_monitor.cache_misses,
            "recent_avg_key_generation_time": self._get_recent_avg_key_generation_time(),
            "recent_avg_cache_operation_time": self._get_recent_avg_cache_operation_time()
        }
        
        # Include invalidation stats if any invalidations have been recorded
        if self.performance_monitor.total_invalidations > 0:
            summary["total_invalidations"] = self.performance_monitor.total_invalidations
            
        # Include memory usage stats if any measurements have been recorded
        if self.performance_monitor.memory_usage_measurements:
            summary["memory_usage"] = self.get_memory_usage_stats()
            
        return summary

->

    def get_performance_summary(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get a summary of cache performance metrics."""
        summary = {
            "hit_ratio": self.get_cache_hit_ratio(),
            "total_operations": self.performance_monitor.total_operations,
            "cache_hits": self.performance_monitor.cache_hits,
            "cache_misses": self.performance_monitor.cache_misses,
            "recent_avg_key_generation_time": self._get_recent_avg_key_generation_time(),
            "recent_avg_cache_operation_time": self._get_recent_avg_cache_operation_time(),
            "total_invalidations": self.performance_monitor.total_invalidations,
            "total_keys_invalidated": self.performance_monitor.total_keys_invalidated
        }
            
        # Include memory usage stats if any measurements have been recorded
        if self.performance_monitor.memory_usage_measurements:
            summary["memory_usage"] = self.get_memory_usage_stats()
            
        return summary
```

Now let's run the failing test to see if it passes:

Excellent! The test is now passing. Let's run all the cache tests to make sure I didn't break anything else:

Perfect! All 130 cache tests are now passing. Let me also update the task status to mark the subtask 7.5 (Redis integration tests) as complete since it appears to have been already implemented, and update the overall Task 7 status.

Now let's mark the overall Task 7 as complete since all subtasks are done:

Perfect! I have successfully:

## Summary of Work Completed

1. **Fixed the failing test**: The test `test_invalidation_integration_with_performance_stats` was expecting the fields `total_invalidations` and `total_keys_invalidated` to always be present in the performance summary, but they were only included conditionally when `total_invalidations > 0`. 

2. **Updated the `get_performance_summary` method**: I modified the method in `backend/app/services/cache.py` to always include these fields in the performance summary, ensuring consistency for the test expectations.

3. **Verified the fix**: All 130 cache tests now pass successfully, confirming that the fix doesn't break any existing functionality.

4. **Updated task statuses**: 
   - Marked subtask 7.4 (Data Compression/Decompression tests) as `done`
   - Marked subtask 7.5 (Redis Integration tests) as `done` 
   - Marked the overall Task 7 (Unit Tests for New Caching Logic) as `done`

## Task 7 Achievement Summary

Task 7 is now **complete** with comprehensive unit test coverage for all the new caching logic:

✅ **Subtask 7.1**: CacheKeyGenerator tests - 30 tests covering all edge cases  
✅ **Subtask 7.2**: AIResponseCache tier selection tests - 14 tests covering tiered caching  
✅ **Subtask 7.3**: Memory cache operations tests - 12 tests covering FIFO eviction and operations  
✅ **Subtask 7.4**: Data compression/decompression tests - 15 tests covering all compression scenarios  
✅ **Subtask 7.5**: Redis cache interaction tests - Comprehensive mocking and integration tests  

The final test count for all cache tests: **130 passed, 0 failed** with robust coverage of:
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Performance characteristics  
- Error handling
- Data integrity
- Compression efficiency
- Memory cache operations
- Redis integration
- Tier selection logic

The caching system is now thoroughly tested and ready for production use.
