Execute Task 6.4: Register the monitoring router with the main FastAPI application

**Cursor**

I'll execute Task 6.4 by registering the monitoring router with the main FastAPI application. Let me first examine the current main.py file and the monitoring router that was created.

Now let me check the monitoring router that was created:

Perfect! Now I can see that the monitoring router has been created with the variable name `monitoring_router`. I need to import this router in main.py and register it with the FastAPI application. Let me make the necessary changes:

```python
from app.services.cache import AIResponseCache
from app.resilience_endpoints import resilience_router

->

from app.services.cache import AIResponseCache
from app.resilience_endpoints import resilience_router
from app.routers.monitoring import monitoring_router
```

Now I need to register the monitoring router with the FastAPI application:

```python
# Include the resilience router
app.include_router(resilience_router)

->

# Include the resilience router
app.include_router(resilience_router)

# Include the monitoring router
app.include_router(monitoring_router)
```

Let me verify the changes by checking the updated section of the main.py file:

Perfect! Now let me update the subtask status and add implementation details to the Task 6 file:

Now let me update the subtask with the implementation details:

Perfect! I have successfully completed Task 6.4: "Register the monitoring router with the main FastAPI application". Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Task 6.4 Complete ✅

**What was implemented:**

1. **Router Import**: Added the import statement for the monitoring router in `backend/app/main.py`:
   ```python
   from app.routers.monitoring import monitoring_router
   ```

2. **Router Registration**: Registered the monitoring router with the main FastAPI application:
   ```python
   app.include_router(monitoring_router)
   ```

3. **Available Endpoints**: The monitoring router now provides these endpoints through the main API:
   - `GET /monitoring/health` - Monitoring system health check
   - `GET /monitoring/cache-metrics` - Comprehensive cache performance metrics

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Clean separation of monitoring functionality into its own router module
- ✅ Consistent URL prefix structure (`/monitoring/*`)
- ✅ Automatic integration with FastAPI's OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- ✅ Maintains existing authentication patterns (optional API key verification)
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing endpoints

The cache performance metrics endpoint is now fully accessible at `GET /monitoring/cache-metrics` and will return comprehensive performance statistics using the `CachePerformanceMonitor.get_performance_stats()` method as originally specified in the task requirements.

**Next Steps**: With all subtasks of Task 6 now complete, the next task to work on would be Task 7: "Unit Tests for New Caching Logic" which will involve creating comprehensive unit tests for the new caching functionalities.

```python
   from app.routers.monitoring import monitoring_router
```

```python
   app.include_router(monitoring_router)
```
