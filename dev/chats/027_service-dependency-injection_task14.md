Execute Task 14: Identify Other Endpoints Requiring DI Refactor

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you execute Task 14 by identifying all FastAPI endpoints that currently use global instances of `TextProcessorService` or `AIResponseCache`. Let me start by exploring the codebase structure and then search for the specific patterns.

Let me broaden the search to understand the current service usage patterns:

Now let me examine the main.py and other endpoint files to understand the current state:

Let me check if there are any other router files in the app directory:

Now let me check for any global service usage patterns:

Let me also check for direct service instantiation patterns:

Now let me update the task with my findings:

I need to use the correct task ID format. Let me update the task status instead:

Perfect! Let me create a summary of the completed task:

## Task 14 Execution Complete ✅

**Objective**: Identify all other FastAPI endpoints that currently use global instances of `TextProcessorService` or `AIResponseCache`.

### Key Findings:

✅ **NO GLOBAL SERVICE INSTANCES FOUND** - The codebase is already properly architected with dependency injection!

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Searched for Original Patterns:**
   - `app.services.text_processor.text_processor` - **NO MATCHES**  
   - `app.services.cache.ai_cache` - **NO MATCHES**

2. **Current Endpoint Architecture:**
   All FastAPI endpoints already use proper dependency injection:

   **main.py endpoints:**
   - `/process` - Uses `text_processor: TextProcessorService = Depends(get_text_processor)`
   - `/batch_process` - Uses `text_processor: TextProcessorService = Depends(get_text_processor)`  
   - `/cache/status` - Uses `cache_service: AIResponseCache = Depends(get_cache_service)`
   - `/cache/invalidate` - Uses `cache_service: AIResponseCache = Depends(get_cache_service)`

   **resilience_endpoints.py endpoints:**
   - `/resilience/health` - Uses `text_processor: TextProcessorService = Depends(get_text_processor)`
   - `/resilience/config` - Uses `text_processor: TextProcessorService = Depends(get_text_processor)`

3. **Service Instantiation:**
   - **TextProcessorService**: Only created via dependency injection in `dependencies.py` 
   - **AIResponseCache**: Only created via dependency injection in `dependencies.py`

### Conclusion:
**NO REFACTORING REQUIRED** - The FastAPI application already follows proper dependency injection patterns throughout. All endpoints use `Depends()` to inject services rather than accessing global instances.

**Next Task**: Task 17 - Create `pytest.fixture` for `mock_processor`
