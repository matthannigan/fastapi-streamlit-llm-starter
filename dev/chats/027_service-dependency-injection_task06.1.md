Execute Task 6.1

**Cursor**

I'll help you execute Task 6.1. First, let me check what Task 6.1 is by looking at the current tasks.

Now I understand! Task 6.1 is about identifying all imports and usages of the global `ai_cache` instance. This is a subtask of Task 6 which is about removing the global `ai_cache` instance. Let me execute this task by scanning the codebase to find all occurrences.

Now let me check the actual source files to see if there are any current imports or usages of the global `ai_cache` in the live Python code:

Let me check the current state of the cache.py and text_processor.py files to see what's actually implemented:

Now let me check the test files to see the specific mocking patterns:

Now let me update the task status with my findings and log the completion of Task 6.1:

Now let me mark this subtask as completed:

Perfect! I have successfully executed Task 6.1. Here's what I accomplished:

## Task 6.1 Execution Summary ✅

**Objective**: Identify all imports and usages of the global `ai_cache` instance

**Key Findings**:

1. **✅ Global Instance Already Removed**: The global `ai_cache = AIResponseCache()` instance has already been removed from `backend/app/services/cache.py`

2. **✅ No Active Imports**: No Python files in the backend currently import `ai_cache` from the cache module

3. **✅ Dependency Injection Implemented**: The `TextProcessorService` properly uses dependency injection with `cache: AIResponseCache` parameter

4. **✅ Only String References**: The only "ai_cache" occurrences in source code are Redis key prefixes (e.g., `"ai_cache:{hash}"`)

5. **⚠️ Legacy Test Mocks**: Found outdated test mocks in `backend/tests/test_main.py` that reference the non-existent global instance

**Status**: **COMPLETED** ✅

The main objective of Task 6.1 has been fulfilled - I've identified and documented all usages of the global `ai_cache` instance. The good news is that the global instance has already been removed and the codebase has been successfully refactored to use dependency injection. 

The legacy test mocks that were found will need to be addressed in subsequent subtasks, but Task 6.1 itself is complete. The next suggested task is Task 8: "Update `TextProcessorService` Internals" which appears to be the logical next step in this dependency injection refactoring.
