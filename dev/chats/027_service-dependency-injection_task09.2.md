Execute Task 9.2

I'll help you execute Task 9.2, which involves defining the asynchronous provider function `get_text_processor` in `dependencies.py`. Let me first examine the current state of the file to understand what's already implemented.

Now I can see the current state of the file. There's already a function `get_text_processor_service` at line 59, but according to the task requirements, I need to implement a new function called `get_text_processor` with a specific signature. Let me implement this function as specified in the task details.

```python
// ... existing code ...

async def get_text_processor(settings: Settings = Depends(get_settings), cache: AIResponseCache = Depends(get_cache_service)) -> TextProcessorService:
    """
    Asynchronous dependency provider for text processor service.
    
    Creates and returns a configured TextProcessorService instance that uses
    the injected settings and cache service. This is the async version of the
    text processor dependency provider.
    
    Args:
        settings: Injected application settings dependency
        cache: Injected cache service dependency
        
    Returns:
        TextProcessorService: Configured text processor service instance
    """
    return TextProcessorService(settings=settings, cache=cache)


def get_text_processor_service(
    settings: Settings = Depends(get_settings),
    cache_service: AIResponseCache = Depends(get_cache_service)
) -> TextProcessorService:
// ... existing code ...
```

Perfect! I've successfully implemented the `get_text_processor` function as specified in Task 9.2. Let me verify the implementation by reading the updated file to ensure it looks correct:

Excellent! The implementation is correct. Now let me update the task status to mark Task 9.2 as completed:

Perfect! Task 9.2 has been successfully completed. Let me also update the subtask details to document what was implemented:

## Summary

✅ **Task 9.2 Successfully Completed**

I have successfully implemented the `get_text_processor` asynchronous dependency provider function in `backend/app/dependencies.py`. Here's what was accomplished:

### Implementation Details:
- **Function Signature**: Implemented exactly as specified: `async def get_text_processor(settings: Settings = Depends(get_settings), cache: AIResponseCache = Depends(get_cache_service)) -> TextProcessorService:`
- **Location**: Added between lines 58-75 in `dependencies.py`
- **Dependencies**: Uses FastAPI's `Depends()` for proper dependency injection of `Settings` and `AIResponseCache`
- **Return**: Creates and returns a `TextProcessorService` instance with injected dependencies
- **Documentation**: Includes comprehensive docstring explaining the async nature and parameters

### Key Features:
- ✅ Async function as required
- ✅ Correct parameter names and types matching the specification
- ✅ Proper dependency injection using FastAPI's `Depends()`
- ✅ Returns `TextProcessorService(settings=settings, cache=cache)`
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ All imports were already available from Task 9.1

The function is now ready for the next subtask (9.3) which involves implementing the return statement and instantiation logic. The implementation follows FastAPI best practices and maintains consistency with the existing codebase structure.
