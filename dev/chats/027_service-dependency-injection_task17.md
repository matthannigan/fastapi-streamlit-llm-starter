Execute Task 17: Create `pytest.fixture` for `mock_processor`

---

**Cursor**

```python
   import pytest
   from unittest.mock import Mock
   from app.services.text_processor import TextProcessorService

   @pytest.fixture
   def mock_processor():
       return Mock(spec=TextProcessorService)
```

I need to execute Task 17, which involves creating a `pytest.fixture` for mocking `TextProcessorService`. Let me first explore the codebase to understand the structure and find the appropriate location for this fixture.

Now let me check the existing test files to see where this fixture should be added and what the current testing structure looks like:

Let me check the conftest.py file since this is where pytest fixtures are commonly defined:

Now let me check if there are any existing mocks for TextProcessorService in the test files:

Let me check for any existing mocks in test_main.py to see the current testing approach:

Now let me check what specific imports and fixtures exist in the test_text_processor.py file to see if there's a pattern to follow:

Now I understand the structure. I need to add a `mock_processor` fixture to the `conftest.py` file that returns a Mock with the TextProcessorService spec. Based on the task requirements and the existing patterns, I'll add this fixture:

```python
import pytest
import asyncio
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch, Mock
from httpx import AsyncClient
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

from app.main import app
from app.services.text_processor import TextProcessorService
from shared.models import TextProcessingRequest, ProcessingOperation

# Test API key for authentication
TEST_API_KEY = "test-api-key-12345"

@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def event_loop():
    """Create an instance of the default event loop for the test session."""
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop_policy().new_event_loop()
    yield loop
    loop.close()

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    """Create a test client for the FastAPI app."""
    return TestClient(app)

@pytest.fixture
async def async_client():
    """Create an async test client."""
    async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as ac:
        yield ac

@pytest.fixture
def auth_headers():
    """Headers with authentication for protected endpoints."""
    return {"Authorization": f"Bearer {TEST_API_KEY}"}

@pytest.fixture
def authenticated_client(client, auth_headers):
    """Test client with authentication headers pre-configured."""
    class AuthenticatedTestClient:
        def __init__(self, client, headers):
            self.client = client
            self.headers = headers
        
        def get(self, url, **kwargs):
            kwargs.setdefault('headers', {}).update(self.headers)
            return self.client.get(url, **kwargs)
        
        def post(self, url, **kwargs):
            kwargs.setdefault('headers', {}).update(self.headers)
            return self.client.post(url, **kwargs)
        
        def put(self, url, **kwargs):
            kwargs.setdefault('headers', {}).update(self.headers)
            return self.client.put(url, **kwargs)
        
        def delete(self, url, **kwargs):
            kwargs.setdefault('headers', {}).update(self.headers)
            return self.client.delete(url, **kwargs)
        
        def patch(self, url, **kwargs):
            kwargs.setdefault('headers', {}).update(self.headers)
            return self.client.patch(url, **kwargs)
        
        def options(self, url, **kwargs):
            kwargs.setdefault('headers', {}).update(self.headers)
            return self.client.options(url, **kwargs)
    
    return AuthenticatedTestClient(client, auth_headers)

@pytest.fixture
def sample_text():
    """Sample text for testing."""
    return """
    Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, 
    in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. 
    Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": 
    any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize 
    its chance of successfully achieving its goals.
    """

@pytest.fixture
def sample_request(sample_text):
    """Sample request for testing."""
    return TextProcessingRequest(
        text=sample_text,
        operation=ProcessingOperation.SUMMARIZE,
        options={"max_length": 100}
    )

@pytest.fixture
def mock_ai_response():
    """Mock AI response for testing."""
    return AsyncMock(return_value=AsyncMock(data="This is a test summary."))

@pytest.fixture
def mock_processor():
    """Mock TextProcessorService for testing."""
    return Mock(spec=TextProcessorService)

// ... existing code ...
```

Perfect! Now let me verify that the fixture works by creating a simple test to ensure the mock object behaves as a TextProcessorService spec. Let me check if the fixture can be imported and used:

That's expected - conftest.py doesn't contain test functions, just fixtures. Let me create a quick test to verify the fixture works correctly:

```python
"""Temporary test file to verify mock_processor fixture functionality."""

import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock
from app.services.text_processor import TextProcessorService


def test_mock_processor_fixture(mock_processor):
    """Test that the mock_processor fixture returns a proper mock."""
    # Verify it's a Mock instance
    assert isinstance(mock_processor, Mock)
    
    # Verify it has the TextProcessorService spec
    assert mock_processor._spec_class == TextProcessorService
    
    # Verify it has the expected methods from TextProcessorService
    assert hasattr(mock_processor, 'process_text')
    assert hasattr(mock_processor, 'process_batch')
    assert hasattr(mock_processor, 'get_resilience_health')
    assert hasattr(mock_processor, 'get_resilience_metrics')
    
    # Verify method calls can be tracked
    mock_processor.process_text.assert_not_called()
    
    # Test that we can call methods (they'll return Mock objects)
    result = mock_processor.process_text()
    assert isinstance(result, Mock)
    mock_processor.process_text.assert_called_once()


def test_mock_processor_can_be_configured(mock_processor):
    """Test that the mock_processor can be configured with return values."""
    from shared.models import TextProcessingResponse, ProcessingOperation
    
    # Configure a return value
    expected_response = TextProcessingResponse(
        operation=ProcessingOperation.SUMMARIZE,
        success=True,
        result="Test summary",
        processing_time=0.5
    )
    mock_processor.process_text.return_value = expected_response
    
    # Call the method and verify the return value
    result = mock_processor.process_text()
    assert result == expected_response
    assert result.success is True
    assert result.operation == ProcessingOperation.SUMMARIZE
```

Now let me run the test to verify the fixture works correctly:

The issue is that the test file is not in the tests directory, so it's not finding the conftest.py file. Let me move the test to the correct location:

Now let me run the test again:

I see the issue! The TextProcessorService methods are async, so when creating a mock with `spec=TextProcessorService`, the methods automatically become async mocks (coroutines). I need to use `AsyncMock` instead of `Mock` for the fixture. Let me fix this:

```python
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch, Mock

->

from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch, Mock
```

```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_processor():
    """Mock TextProcessorService for testing."""
    return Mock(spec=TextProcessorService)

->

@pytest.fixture
def mock_processor():
    """Mock TextProcessorService for testing."""
    return AsyncMock(spec=TextProcessorService)
```

Now I need to update the verification test to handle async methods properly:

```python
"""Temporary test file to verify mock_processor fixture functionality."""

import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock
from app.services.text_processor import TextProcessorService


def test_mock_processor_fixture(mock_processor):
    """Test that the mock_processor fixture returns a proper mock."""
    # Verify it's a Mock instance
    assert isinstance(mock_processor, Mock)
    
    # Verify it has the TextProcessorService spec
    assert mock_processor._spec_class == TextProcessorService
    
    # Verify it has the expected methods from TextProcessorService
    assert hasattr(mock_processor, 'process_text')
    assert hasattr(mock_processor, 'process_batch')
    assert hasattr(mock_processor, 'get_resilience_health')
    assert hasattr(mock_processor, 'get_resilience_metrics')
    
    # Verify method calls can be tracked
    mock_processor.process_text.assert_not_called()
    
    # Test that we can call methods (they'll return Mock objects)
    result = mock_processor.process_text()
    assert isinstance(result, Mock)
    mock_processor.process_text.assert_called_once()


def test_mock_processor_can_be_configured(mock_processor):
    """Test that the mock_processor can be configured with return values."""
    from shared.models import TextProcessingResponse, ProcessingOperation
    
    # Configure a return value
    expected_response = TextProcessingResponse(
        operation=ProcessingOperation.SUMMARIZE,
        success=True,
        result="Test summary",
        processing_time=0.5
    )
    mock_processor.process_text.return_value = expected_response
    
    # Call the method and verify the return value
    result = mock_processor.process_text()
    assert result == expected_response
    assert result.success is True
    assert result.operation == ProcessingOperation.SUMMARIZE

->

"""Temporary test file to verify mock_processor fixture functionality."""

import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock
from app.services.text_processor import TextProcessorService


def test_mock_processor_fixture(mock_processor):
    """Test that the mock_processor fixture returns a proper async mock."""
    # Verify it's an AsyncMock instance
    assert isinstance(mock_processor, AsyncMock)
    
    # Verify it has the TextProcessorService spec
    assert mock_processor._spec_class == TextProcessorService
    
    # Verify it has the expected methods from TextProcessorService
    assert hasattr(mock_processor, 'process_text')
    assert hasattr(mock_processor, 'process_batch')
    assert hasattr(mock_processor, 'get_resilience_health')
    assert hasattr(mock_processor, 'get_resilience_metrics')
    
    # Verify method calls can be tracked
    mock_processor.process_text.assert_not_called()


@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_mock_processor_can_be_configured(mock_processor):
    """Test that the mock_processor can be configured with return values."""
    from shared.models import TextProcessingResponse, ProcessingOperation
    
    # Configure a return value
    expected_response = TextProcessingResponse(
        operation=ProcessingOperation.SUMMARIZE,
        success=True,
        result="Test summary",
        processing_time=0.5
    )
    mock_processor.process_text.return_value = expected_response
    
    # Call the method and verify the return value (since it's async)
    result = await mock_processor.process_text()
    assert result == expected_response
    assert result.success is True
    assert result.operation == ProcessingOperation.SUMMARIZE
```

Now let me run the test again to verify that the fixture works correctly:

Perfect! The mock_processor fixture is working correctly. Now let me clean up by removing the temporary verification test file:

Now let me run some of the existing tests to ensure the new fixture doesn't break anything:

Excellent! Let me also verify that the fixture is available by running a quick command to list all available fixtures:

Perfect! Now let me update the task status to mark this task as complete:

Perfect! Let me also update the task with notes about what was implemented:

That's fine - the task is already marked as done so it doesn't allow updates. Let me quickly verify the implementation by looking at the final state of the conftest.py file:

Perfect! The implementation is complete and working correctly. 

## Summary

I have successfully executed Task 17: **Create `pytest.fixture` for `mock_processor`**

### What was implemented:

✅ **Added the `mock_processor` fixture to `backend/tests/conftest.py`** with the following features:

1. **Proper imports**: Added `AsyncMock` and `TextProcessorService` imports
2. **Correct mock type**: Used `AsyncMock(spec=TextProcessorService)` instead of `Mock` since the TextProcessorService methods are async
3. **Proper spec**: The mock adheres to the TextProcessorService specification, ensuring it has all the correct methods and attributes
4. **Test compatibility**: The fixture is available to all test files in the `backend/tests/` directory

### Key implementation details:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_processor():
    """Mock TextProcessorService for testing."""
    return AsyncMock(spec=TextProcessorService)
```

### Verification:

✅ **Created and ran verification tests** to ensure:
- The fixture returns an `AsyncMock` instance with the correct spec
- It has all the expected methods from `TextProcessorService`
- It can be configured with return values
- Method calls can be tracked
- Async methods work correctly with `await`

✅ **Confirmed existing tests still pass** with the new fixture in place

✅ **Verified the fixture is available** in the pytest fixtures list

The `mock_processor` fixture is now ready to be used in dependency injection tests, particularly for the next task (Task 18) which involves updating the `/process` endpoint tests to use `app.dependency_overrides` with this mock.

```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_processor():
    """Mock TextProcessorService for testing."""
    return AsyncMock(spec=TextProcessorService)
```
