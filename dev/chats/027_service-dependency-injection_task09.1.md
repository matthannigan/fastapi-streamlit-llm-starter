Execute Task 9.1

---

**Cursor**

I'll execute Task 9.1, which involves adding the required imports to `backend/app/dependencies.py`. Let me start by examining the current state of the dependencies file and then add the necessary imports.

Now let me examine the current `dependencies.py` file to see what imports are already present:

I can see that the `dependencies.py` file already has most of the required imports! Let me check what's already imported and what might be missing:

**Current imports:**
- ✅ `Settings` - imported from `.config`
- ✅ `get_settings` - defined in the file (line 11)
- ✅ `get_cache_service` - defined in the file (line 35)
- ✅ `TextProcessorService` - imported from `.services.text_processor`
- ✅ `Depends` - imported from `fastapi`

Looking at the file, I notice that there's already a function called `get_text_processor_service` (line 59) which seems to be very similar to what Task 9 is asking for. However, the task specifically calls for a function named `get_text_processor` (not `get_text_processor_service`).

Let me also check if there are any additional imports needed by looking at the task requirements more carefully. The task asks for:
1. `TextProcessorService` from `app.services.text_processor` ✅ Already imported
2. `Settings` ✅ Already imported 
3. `get_settings` ✅ Already defined
4. `get_cache_service` ✅ Already defined

All the required imports are already present in the file! The dependencies.py file is properly set up with all the necessary imports for implementing the `get_text_processor` function.

Let me update the subtask with this information and mark it as complete:

Now let me mark this subtask as complete:

Perfect! Task 9.1 has been successfully completed. 

## ✅ Task 9.1 Complete: Import Required Modules and Services

**Summary:** All required imports were already present in `backend/app/dependencies.py`:

- ✅ `Settings` - imported from `.config`
- ✅ `get_settings` - function defined in the file  
- ✅ `get_cache_service` - function defined in the file
- ✅ `TextProcessorService` - imported from `.services.text_processor`
- ✅ `Depends` - imported from `fastapi`
- ✅ `AIResponseCache` - imported from `.services.cache`

**Key Finding:** The file already contains a similar function called `get_text_processor_service` (line 59), but the task specifically requires implementing a function named `get_text_processor`.

**Next Step:** The next subtask (9.2) is now ready to be executed, which involves defining the asynchronous provider function `get_text_processor` with the correct signature and dependency injection.
