I need to examine the current test failures and fix the issues in Task 7.4. Let me first look at the test file to understand the current state and identify the specific problems.

Let me look at the specific failing tests for compression/decompression:

Now I can see the issue. The failing tests are expecting specific fields in the test data that don't exist. Let me examine the actual compression/decompression logic to understand what data structure it returns:

Let me look at the compression/decompression methods specifically:

Now I understand the issue. The old compression tests in the first part of the test file (around lines 520-570) are trying to access fields that don't exist in the test data. Looking at the actual compression methods, they just take whatever data is passed to them and compress/decompress it without adding extra fields. Let me fix these failing tests.

Looking at the errors, I need to fix:
1. `test_compression_data_small_data` - tries to access `decompressed["success"]` and `decompressed["metadata"]["size"]` which don't exist
2. `test_compression_data_large_data` - tries to access `decompressed["metadata"]["compression"]` which doesn't exist

Let me look at the actual TestDataCompressionDecompression class that was implemented in task 7.4:

Now I understand the issue. There are two sets of compression tests:

1. **Old/broken tests** in the TestAIResponseCache class (around lines 520-570) that have incorrect expectations
2. **Proper tests** in the TestDataCompressionDecompression class (lines 2463+) that work correctly

The failing tests `test_compression_data_small_data` and `test_compression_data_large_data` are in the old section and have wrong assumptions about the data structure. Let me fix these:

```python
    def test_compression_data_small_data(self, cache_instance):
        """Test that small data is not compressed."""
        small_data = {"result": "small", "cached_at": "2024-01-01"}
        
        compressed = cache_instance._compress_data(small_data)
        
        # Should start with "raw:" prefix for uncompressed data
        assert compressed.startswith(b"raw:")
        
        # Should be able to decompress back to original
        decompressed = cache_instance._decompress_data(compressed)
        assert decompressed == small_data
        
        # Verify data integrity
        assert decompressed["result"] == "small"
        assert decompressed["success"] is True
        assert decompressed["metadata"]["size"] == "small"

->

    def test_compression_data_small_data(self, cache_instance):
        """Test that small data is not compressed."""
        small_data = {
            "result": "small", 
            "cached_at": "2024-01-01",
            "success": True,
            "metadata": {"size": "small"}
        }
        
        compressed = cache_instance._compress_data(small_data)
        
        # Should start with "raw:" prefix for uncompressed data
        assert compressed.startswith(b"raw:")
        
        # Should be able to decompress back to original
        decompressed = cache_instance._decompress_data(compressed)
        assert decompressed == small_data
        
        # Verify data integrity
        assert decompressed["result"] == "small"
        assert decompressed["success"] is True
        assert decompressed["metadata"]["size"] == "small"
```

```python
    def test_compression_data_large_data(self, cache_instance):
        """Test that large data is compressed."""
        # Create large data that exceeds compression threshold
        large_text = "A" * 2000  # Larger than default 1000 byte threshold
        large_data = {
            "result": large_text,
            "cached_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00",
            "operation": "summarize",
            "success": True
        }
        
        compressed = cache_instance._compress_data(large_data)
        
        # Should start with "compressed:" prefix for compressed data
        assert compressed.startswith(b"compressed:")
        
        # Compressed data should be smaller than original
        import pickle
        original_size = len(pickle.dumps(large_data))
        compressed_size = len(compressed) - 11  # Remove prefix length
        assert compressed_size < original_size
        
        # Should be able to decompress back to original
        decompressed = cache_instance._decompress_data(compressed)
        assert decompressed == large_data
        
        # Verify data integrity for complex structures
        assert len(decompressed["result"]) == len(large_text)
        assert decompressed["metadata"]["compression"] is True

->

    def test_compression_data_large_data(self, cache_instance):
        """Test that large data is compressed."""
        # Create large data that exceeds compression threshold
        large_text = "A" * 2000  # Larger than default 1000 byte threshold
        large_data = {
            "result": large_text,
            "cached_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00",
            "operation": "summarize",
            "success": True,
            "metadata": {"compression": True}
        }
        
        compressed = cache_instance._compress_data(large_data)
        
        # Should start with "compressed:" prefix for compressed data
        assert compressed.startswith(b"compressed:")
        
        # Compressed data should be smaller than original
        import pickle
        original_size = len(pickle.dumps(large_data))
        compressed_size = len(compressed) - 11  # Remove prefix length
        assert compressed_size < original_size
        
        # Should be able to decompress back to original
        decompressed = cache_instance._decompress_data(compressed)
        assert decompressed == large_data
        
        # Verify data integrity for complex structures
        assert len(decompressed["result"]) == len(large_text)
        assert decompressed["metadata"]["compression"] is True
```

Now let me fix the other failing tests. Let me look at the monitoring/memory usage test error:

I see the issue. Looking at line 1351, the test is trying to access `measurement.memory_cache_entries` but the error says the attribute is called `memory_cache_entry_count`. Let me look at the monitoring module to understand the correct attribute name:

Perfect! The correct attribute name is `memory_cache_entry_count`. Let me fix this:

```python
        measurement = memory_cache_instance.performance_monitor.memory_usage_measurements[0]
        assert measurement.memory_cache_entries == 50  # Should track all entries

->

        measurement = memory_cache_instance.performance_monitor.memory_usage_measurements[0]
        assert measurement.memory_cache_entry_count == 50  # Should track all entries
```

Now let me run the tests to see if I've fixed the compression issues and identify what other issues remain:

Great! Those 3 tests are now passing. Now let me run all the tests to see what failures remain:

Great progress! We're down to just 5 failing tests. The compression tests are now all passing. Let me analyze the remaining issues:

1. **Performance summary issues**: Two tests expect `total_invalidations` and `memory_usage` in the performance summary, but they're not included.
2. **Mock async issues**: Three tests have issues with mocking async operations, getting "object list/MagicMock can't be used in 'await' expression" errors.

Let me look at the performance summary method to understand what fields it includes:

I can see that the `get_performance_summary()` method (lines 625-631) only includes a basic set of fields and doesn't include `total_invalidations` or `memory_usage` that the failing tests are expecting. Let me check what fields the performance monitor actually has available:

I can see that there are specific methods for getting invalidation and memory usage stats. The failing tests expect these to be included in the `get_performance_summary()` method. Let me update the performance summary to include these additional fields:

```python
    def get_performance_summary(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get a summary of cache performance metrics."""
        return {
            "hit_ratio": self.get_cache_hit_ratio(),
            "total_operations": self.performance_monitor.total_operations,
            "cache_hits": self.performance_monitor.cache_hits,
            "cache_misses": self.performance_monitor.cache_misses,
            "recent_avg_key_generation_time": self._get_recent_avg_key_generation_time(),
            "recent_avg_cache_operation_time": self._get_recent_avg_cache_operation_time()
        }

->

    def get_performance_summary(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get a summary of cache performance metrics."""
        summary = {
            "hit_ratio": self.get_cache_hit_ratio(),
            "total_operations": self.performance_monitor.total_operations,
            "cache_hits": self.performance_monitor.cache_hits,
            "cache_misses": self.performance_monitor.cache_misses,
            "recent_avg_key_generation_time": self._get_recent_avg_key_generation_time(),
            "recent_avg_cache_operation_time": self._get_recent_avg_cache_operation_time()
        }
        
        # Include invalidation stats if any invalidations have been recorded
        if self.performance_monitor.total_invalidations > 0:
            summary["total_invalidations"] = self.performance_monitor.total_invalidations
            
        # Include memory usage stats if any measurements have been recorded
        if self.performance_monitor.memory_usage_measurements:
            summary["memory_usage"] = self.get_memory_usage_stats()
            
        return summary
```

Now let me address the async mocking issues. The problem is that the tests are trying to set up mocks but the actual async operations are failing because the mocks aren't set up properly. Let me look at the failing tests:

The issue is that the `memory_mock_redis.setex` is a `MagicMock` object, not an `AsyncMock`, so when the code tries to `await` it, it fails. Looking at the mock setup:

I can see the issue. The `memory_mock_redis` fixture is missing the `setex` and `keys` methods that are needed for the failing tests. Let me add them:

```python
    @pytest.fixture
    def memory_mock_redis(self):
        """Mock Redis instance for memory cache testing."""
        mock = MagicMock()
        mock.get = AsyncMock()
        mock.set = AsyncMock()
        mock.delete = AsyncMock()
        mock.scan_iter = AsyncMock()
        mock.info = AsyncMock()
        return mock

->

    @pytest.fixture
    def memory_mock_redis(self):
        """Mock Redis instance for memory cache testing."""
        mock = MagicMock()
        mock.get = AsyncMock()
        mock.set = AsyncMock()
        mock.setex = AsyncMock()
        mock.delete = AsyncMock()
        mock.keys = AsyncMock()
        mock.scan_iter = AsyncMock()
        mock.info = AsyncMock()
        return mock
```

Now let me run the tests again to see if this fixes the async mock issues:

I'll continue from where we left off with Task 7.4. Let me first check the current status of the test that's still failing and then fix it.

It seems like the test wasn't found. Let me check if the test exists and what tests are actually available in the file:

Let me check what tests actually exist in the cache test file:

Let me see the rest of the file to find the failing test:

I can see that this test file exists but it doesn't contain the failing test `test_invalidation_integration_with_performance_stats` mentioned in the conversation summary. Let me check if there are other cache test files or if this test is in a different location:
