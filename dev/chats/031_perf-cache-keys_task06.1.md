Execute Task 6.1: Create a new router module for monitoring endpoints

---

**Cursor**

I'll execute Task 6.1 by creating a new router module for monitoring endpoints. Let me first check the current backend structure and examine existing patterns in the codebase.

I see the routers directory doesn't exist yet. Let me check the existing code to understand the patterns used in this project for imports and router structure.

Now let me check how the resilience router is structured to understand the pattern used in this project:

Let me also check if there's a CachePerformanceMonitor class in the services directory to understand how to import it:

Perfect! I can see that the `CachePerformanceMonitor` class exists in `backend/app/services/monitoring.py`. Now I'll create the new router module for monitoring endpoints. Let me first create the routers directory and then the monitoring router file.

```python
"""Backend routers package."""
```

```python
"""
Monitoring endpoints for cache performance metrics and system monitoring.

This module provides endpoints for exposing cache performance statistics
and other monitoring-related functionality.
"""

from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException, status
from typing import Dict, Any
from app.auth import verify_api_key, optional_verify_api_key
from app.services.monitoring import CachePerformanceMonitor
from app.dependencies import get_cache_service
from app.services.cache import AIResponseCache

# Create a router for monitoring endpoints
monitoring_router = APIRouter(prefix="/monitoring", tags=["monitoring"])


@monitoring_router.get("/health")
async def get_monitoring_health(api_key: str = Depends(optional_verify_api_key)):
    """
    Get the health status of the monitoring system.
    
    Returns basic information about monitoring service availability.
    """
    try:
        return {
            "status": "healthy",
            "monitoring_service": "available",
            "endpoints": [
                "GET /monitoring/health",
                "GET /monitoring/cache-metrics"
            ]
        }
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
            detail=f"Failed to get monitoring health: {str(e)}"
        )
```

Perfect! I've successfully created Task 6.1 by:

1. **Created the routers directory structure** - Added `backend/app/routers/__init__.py` to properly initialize the routers package
2. **Created the monitoring router module** - Created `backend/app/routers/monitoring.py` with:
   - Proper imports including FastAPI's `APIRouter`, authentication dependencies, and the `CachePerformanceMonitor` class
   - A `monitoring_router` instance with appropriate prefix (`/monitoring`) and tags (`["monitoring"]`)
   - A basic health endpoint to verify the router is working
   - Comprehensive docstrings explaining the module's purpose

The monitoring router is now ready to house the cache performance metrics endpoint and other future monitoring-related endpoints. The module follows the same patterns established in the project, particularly mirroring the structure used in `resilience_endpoints.py`.

Excellent! Task 6.1 has been completed successfully. I've created a new router module for monitoring endpoints at `backend/app/routers/monitoring.py` with:

✅ **Created the directory structure** - Added the `routers` package with proper `__init__.py`
✅ **Initialized FastAPI router** - Set up `monitoring_router` with appropriate prefix (`/monitoring`) and tags (`["monitoring"]`)
✅ **Added necessary imports** - Included FastAPI's `APIRouter`, authentication dependencies, and the `CachePerformanceMonitor` class from `app.services.monitoring`
✅ **Added basic functionality** - Created a health endpoint to verify the router works properly
✅ **Followed project patterns** - Used the same structure and conventions as the existing `resilience_endpoints.py`

The router is now ready for the next subtasks where we'll implement the actual cache performance metrics endpoint (6.2) and the supporting Pydantic models (6.3). The foundation is solid and follows the project's established patterns.
