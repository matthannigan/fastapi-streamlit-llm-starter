# Python Modernization Project PRD (Updated for Current Architecture)

## Overview  
This project modernizes the FastAPI-Streamlit-LLM-Starter to use Python 3.12 as the default development and deployment target, while maintaining compatibility testing across Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13. This migration addresses end-of-life concerns for Python 3.9 (EOL October 2025), leverages significant performance improvements in Python 3.11+ (10-60% speed gains), and positions the project for modern Python features like improved error messages, structural pattern matching, and better typing support.

**Current State Assessment**: The recent backend refactoring has modernized the architecture with production-ready infrastructure services, but Python version configuration remains inconsistent - Docker containers use Python 3.11, CI/CD tests Python 3.9-3.11, and the shared library allows Python 3.8+.

The target users are developers working on this project who will benefit from faster development cycles, better debugging experiences, and access to modern Python ecosystem features. This modernization is valuable because it ensures long-term maintainability, improved performance, and compatibility with current industry standards.

**Integration with Existing Architecture**: This update builds on the recent backend refactoring that established production-ready infrastructure services (cache, resilience, monitoring, security). The Python modernization will enhance these existing capabilities without disrupting the established architectural patterns.

## Core Features  

### Python Version Matrix Testing
- **What it does**: Updates existing GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline from testing Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 to testing Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13
- **Why it's important**: Ensures compatibility across supported versions, catches version-specific issues early, and removes EOL Python version testing
- **How it works**: Updates .github/workflows/test.yml matrix strategy to test against modern Python versions only

### Default Python 3.12 Development Environment
- **What it does**: Upgrades from current Python 3.11 Docker images to Python 3.12 as the primary development and deployment target
- **Why it's important**: Leverages additional performance improvements and modern language features while maintaining stability
- **How it works**: Updates Docker base images from 3.11-slim to 3.12-slim, development documentation, and local environment setup scripts

### Modern Project Configuration
- **What it does**: Implements pyproject.toml-based configuration for the entire project
- **Why it's important**: Follows modern Python packaging standards and centralizes project metadata
- **How it works**: Creates root-level pyproject.toml with project metadata, tool configurations, and Python version constraints

### Container Modernization
- **What it does**: Updates existing Python 3.11-slim Docker images to use Python 3.12-slim base images
- **Why it's important**: Provides additional performance improvements and ensures consistency with new development target
- **How it works**: Updates both backend/Dockerfile and frontend/Dockerfile base images, validates existing multi-stage builds work with new version

- **CI/CD Matrix**: Currently tests `["3.9", "3.10", "3.11"]`
- **Shared Library**: `shared/pyproject.toml` requires `">=3.8"`
- **Project Configuration**: No root-level `pyproject.toml` exists
- **Development Environment**: No `.python-version` file specified
- **Architecture**: Production-ready infrastructure services already established
