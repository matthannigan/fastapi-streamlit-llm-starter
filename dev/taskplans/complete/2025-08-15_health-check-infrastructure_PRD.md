# Health Check Infrastructure PRD

## Overview  
The Health Check Infrastructure service transforms the existing placeholder health monitoring into a production-ready infrastructure component that provides standardized health checking capabilities across the FastAPI-Streamlit-LLM Starter Template. This solves the current problem where health check logic is duplicated in API endpoints and lacks a reusable, business-agnostic infrastructure layer.

**Target Users**: Template users who need reliable system monitoring, operations teams managing deployments, and developers building health-aware applications.

**Value Proposition**: Provides enterprise-grade health monitoring with standardized interfaces, comprehensive component checking, and seamless integration with existing monitoring systems while maintaining the template's architectural separation between infrastructure and domain services.

## Core Features  

### Standardized Health Check Framework
- **What**: Unified health check system with `HealthStatus` enum, `ComponentStatus` dataclass, and `SystemHealthStatus` aggregation
- **Why**: Eliminates duplicate health check logic and provides consistent health reporting across all system components
- **How**: Implements async health checker with component registration, timeout handling, and metadata collection

### Built-in Component Health Checks
- **What**: Pre-built health check functions for AI models (Gemini API), cache systems (Redis/memory), and resilience patterns (circuit breakers)
- **Why**: Provides immediately useful health monitoring without requiring custom implementation from template users
- **How**: Async health check functions with configurable timeouts, error handling, and detailed status reporting

### Performance Metrics Integration
- **What**: Health check response time tracking, component availability statistics, and performance trend analysis
- **Why**: Enables proactive monitoring and performance optimization based on health check patterns
- **How**: Integrates with existing `CachePerformanceMonitor` and resilience orchestrator metrics

## External Monitoring Integration
- **What**: Export capabilities for Prometheus, JSON, and custom monitoring systems with standardized health endpoints
- **Why**: Seamless integration with enterprise monitoring stacks and container orchestration health checks
- **How**: Structured health data export with configurable formats and external system webhooks

## User Experience

## Technical Architecture  

### System Components
- **Core Health Classes**: `HealthChecker`, `SystemHealthStatus`, `ComponentStatus` with async health checking engine
- **Component Health Functions**: Async health check implementations for AI, cache, resilience, and database components
- **Monitoring Integration**: Connection to existing `CachePerformanceMonitor` and resilience orchestrator
- **Export System**: Multi-format health data export (JSON, Prometheus) with external system integration

### Data Models
```python
# Health status enumeration
class HealthStatus(Enum):
    HEALTHY = "healthy"
    DEGRADED = "degraded" 
    UNHEALTHY = "unhealthy"

# Component health details
@dataclass
class ComponentStatus:
    name: str
    status: HealthStatus
    message: str = ""
    response_time_ms: float = 0.0
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = None

# System-wide health aggregation
@dataclass
class SystemHealthStatus:
    overall_status: HealthStatus
    components: List[ComponentStatus]
    timestamp: float
```

### APIs and Integrations
- **Infrastructure API**: Health checker registration, component status queries, system health aggregation
- **Existing `/v1/health` Endpoint**: Refactored to use infrastructure service while maintaining response compatibility
- **External Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics export, webhook notifications, dashboard integration
- **Dependency Injection**: Health checker factory integration with FastAPI dependency system

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Async Framework**: Full async/await support for non-blocking health checks
- **Error Isolation**: Health check failures must not impact application functionality
- **Performance Targets**: <5ms for individual health checks, <50ms for system health aggregation
- **Memory Efficiency**: Bounded memory usage with configurable retention policies

**Mitigation**: Implement bounded data structures, configurable retention policies, automatic cleanup mechanisms

### MVP Definition & Scope Management
**Risk**: Over-engineering the initial implementation
**Mitigation**: Focus Phase 1 on core health checking framework only, defer advanced features to later phases, maintain simple API surface

**Risk**: Integration complexity with existing monitoring systems
**Mitigation**: Leverage existing `CachePerformanceMonitor` patterns, reuse established monitoring infrastructure, implement step-by-step integration

### Resource & Development Constraints
**Risk**: Test coverage requirements (>90%) creating development bottlenecks
**Mitigation**: Implement testing alongside development, use established patterns from cache/resilience testing, automate test execution

**Risk**: Documentation and example creation taking significant time
**Mitigation**: Reuse existing infrastructure documentation patterns, focus on usage examples over comprehensive API docs, leverage existing monitoring guides
