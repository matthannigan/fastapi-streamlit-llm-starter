# Backend App Directory Refactor PRD

# Overview  
The current `/backend/app` directory has grown organically and now suffers from poor organization, oversized files, and mixed concerns that violate the Single Responsibility Principle. This refactor will restructure the FastAPI application into a clean, maintainable, and scalable architecture following industry best practices.

**Problem Statement:**
- Oversized files (config.py: 37KB, resilience_endpoints.py: 46KB, validation_schemas.py: 49KB)
- Mixed concerns within single files (business logic, API routing, configuration)
- Difficult to maintain, test, and extend
- Poor separation between API layer, business logic, and configuration

**Target Audience:**
- Development team members working on the FastAPI backend
- Future developers joining the project
- DevOps engineers deploying and maintaining the system

**Value Proposition:**
- Improved maintainability through smaller, focused files
- Enhanced testability with clear separation of concerns
- Better scalability for future feature additions
- Reduced cognitive load for developers
- Follows FastAPI and Python best practices

# Core Features  

## 1. Modular Configuration Management
**What it does:** Splits the monolithic config.py into focused configuration modules
**Why it's important:** Easier to manage environment-specific settings and reduces cognitive overhead
**How it works:** 
- Base settings in `core/config/base.py`
- Feature-specific configs (API, resilience, cache, security) in separate modules
- Composite configuration class that aggregates all settings

## 2. API Layer Reorganization  
**What it does:** Separates API routing from business logic with clear endpoint organization
**Why it's important:** Follows REST principles and makes API maintenance straightforward
**How it works:**
- API versioning structure (`/api/v1/`)
- Logical endpoint grouping by functionality
- Separate monitoring/admin APIs from core business APIs
- Clean dependency injection patterns

## 3. Service Layer Architecture
**What it does:** Implements proper business logic separation with focused service modules
**Why it's important:** Enables unit testing, code reuse, and clear business logic boundaries
**How it works:**
- Text processing services isolated from API concerns
- Cache services with multiple implementation strategies
- Resilience services with modular circuit breaker and retry logic
- Monitoring services for metrics and health checks

## 4. Schema Organization
**What it does:** Organizes Pydantic models by purpose (requests, responses, validation)
**Why it's important:** Improves API contract clarity and validation maintainability
**How it works:**
- Request models grouped by feature
- Response models with clear typing
- Complex validation schemas in dedicated modules

## 5. Security & Validation Isolation
**What it does:** Centralizes security concerns and validation logic
**Why it's important:** Easier to audit, maintain, and enhance security measures
**How it works:**
- Authentication logic separated from API routing
- Validation schemas organized by complexity and purpose
- Security utilities in dedicated modules

## Design Principles
1. **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each module has one clear purpose
2. **Dependency Inversion:** Business logic doesn't depend on frameworks
3. **Separation of Concerns:** API, business logic, and configuration are isolated
4. **Open/Closed Principle:** Easy to extend without modifying existing code

## Integration Points
- Existing `/backend/tests` structure remains unchanged initially
- Current Docker configuration remains compatible
- Environment variables and deployment scripts unaffected
- Shared models compatibility maintained

# Development Roadmap  

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Core Infrastructure)
**Scope:** Create new directory structure and base configuration system
- Create new directory structure with placeholder files
- Extract and modularize configuration system from config.py
- Set up core exception handling and middleware
- Implement basic dependency injection patterns
- Update main.py to use new structure

## Phase 2: API Layer Refactor (Endpoint Organization)  
**Scope:** Restructure FastAPI routing and endpoint organization
- Extract core business endpoints to api/v1/endpoints/
- Separate monitoring endpoints to api/monitoring/
- Implement API versioning structure
- Refactor authentication and authorization dependencies
- Update CORS and middleware configuration

## Phase 3: Service Layer Extraction (Business Logic)
**Scope:** Extract and organize business logic into service modules
- Refactor text processing service with clear interfaces
- Modularize cache services (Redis, memory cache)
- Extract resilience services (circuit breaker, retry, strategies)
- Organize monitoring and health check services
- Implement AI client abstraction

## Phase 4: Schema Organization (Data Models)
**Scope:** Organize Pydantic models and validation schemas
- Separate request and response models by feature
- Extract complex validation schemas to dedicated modules  
- Implement security validation utilities
- Organize resilience configuration validation

## Phase 5: Integration & Testing (Import Updates)
**Scope:** Update all imports and ensure system integration
- Update all internal imports to use new structure
- Fix any circular dependency issues
- Update test imports to match new structure
- Validate all endpoints continue to function
- Performance testing to ensure no degradation

## Phase 6: Documentation & Cleanup (Final Polish)
**Scope:** Documentation updates and removal of old files
- Update API documentation to reflect new structure
- Add module-level docstrings explaining each component
- Remove old files after successful migration
- Update development documentation

# Logical Dependency Chain

## Foundation First (Phase 1)
**Dependencies:** None
**Critical Path:** Core configuration and directory structure must be established before any other work

## Bottom-Up Service Extraction (Phases 2-4)
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 complete
**Strategy:** 
1. Start with services layer (least dependent)
2. Move to API layer (depends on services)
3. Organize schemas (depends on both API and services)
4. This approach minimizes breaking changes during development

## Integration Testing Throughout
**Dependencies:** Each phase completion
**Strategy:** After each phase, validate that existing functionality remains intact

## Atomic Module Creation
**Approach:** Each new module should be:
- Completely functional when created
- Testable in isolation
- Have clear interfaces
- Be immediately usable by dependent modules

## Risk Mitigation Through Parallel Development
- Keep old structure functioning while building new structure
- Use feature flags or imports to switch between old/new implementations
- Validate each component before removing old code

# Risks and Mitigations  

## Technical Challenges

### Risk: Circular Import Dependencies
**Mitigation:** 
- Careful dependency analysis during planning
- Use of dependency injection patterns
- Late imports where necessary
- Clear interface definitions

### Risk: Breaking Changes During Refactor
**Mitigation:**
- Maintain parallel old/new implementations during transition  
- Comprehensive testing after each phase
- Feature flags to switch between implementations
- Rollback plan for each phase

### Risk: Performance Degradation
**Mitigation:**
- Performance benchmarking before and after refactor
- Profile import times and module loading
- Optimize critical paths identified during testing

## Scope and Resource Constraints

### Risk: Scope Creep with Test Refactoring
**Mitigation:** 
- Explicitly exclude test restructuring from this PRD
- Document test import updates as separate maintenance task
- Plan separate PRD for test optimization after app refactor completion

### Risk: Extended Development Time
**Mitigation:**
- Phased approach allows for incremental progress
- Each phase delivers value independently
- Can pause after any phase if priorities change

### Risk: Team Coordination During Refactor
**Mitigation:**
- Clear communication about which files are being modified
- Branch strategy that minimizes merge conflicts
- Documentation of new patterns for team adoption

## MVP Definition

**Minimum Viable Refactor:** Successfully restructure the most problematic files (config.py, resilience_endpoints.py) while maintaining all existing functionality.

**Success Criteria:**
- All existing tests pass
- No performance degradation
- Clear improvement in file organization and maintainability
- Team can effectively work with new structure

# Appendix  

## Current File Size Analysis
- config.py: 37KB, 787 lines - Configuration management
- resilience_endpoints.py: 46KB, 1299 lines - Resilience API endpoints  
- validation_schemas.py: 49KB, 1125 lines - Validation logic
- main.py: 11KB, 294 lines - FastAPI app and core endpoints

## Single Responsibility Principle Application
**Definition:** Each module should have one reason to change.

**Current Violations:**
- config.py handles API, resilience, cache, and security settings
- resilience_endpoints.py mixes routing, validation, and business logic
- main.py handles app setup, routing, and business logic

**Post-Refactor Compliance:**
- Each config module handles one domain (API settings, cache settings, etc.)
- API modules only handle routing and request/response transformation
- Service modules only handle business logic
- Schema modules only handle data validation

## Test Strategy During Refactor
**Approach:** Maintain existing `/backend/tests` structure during app refactor
- Update only import statements in tests
- Keep all existing tests passing throughout refactor
- Use existing test suite to validate refactored functionality
- Plan separate test structure optimization as future enhancement

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
- Test directory restructuring to mirror new app structure
- Additional monitoring and observability features
- API documentation generation automation
- Enhanced development tooling integration

## Migration Utilities
- Import update scripts for automated search/replace
- Validation scripts to ensure no broken imports
- Performance comparison tools for before/after analysis
