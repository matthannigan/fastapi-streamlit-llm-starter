# Testing Documentation Modernization Task Plan

## Context and Rationale

The testing documentation requires comprehensive restructuring following the creation of a detailed `docs/guides/testing/INTEGRATION_TESTS.md` guide. The current documentation has gaps in unit testing guidance, content scattered across multiple files without clear separation of concerns, and missing comprehensive documentation for behavior-driven testing patterns. This modernization addresses the documentation imbalance between integration and unit testing, consolidates testing philosophy into clear actionable guides, and creates a balanced documentation architecture that supports both unit and integration testing excellence.

### Identified Documentation Gaps
- **Unit Testing Guide**: No comprehensive unit testing document despite having detailed integration testing guidance
- **Content Organization**: Testing concepts scattered across `docs/guides/testing/TESTING.md`, `docs/guides/testing/1_WRITING_TESTS.md`, and `docs/guides/testing/4_TEST_STRUCTURE.md` without clear boundaries
- **AI-Assisted Workflows**: Unit test development prompts exist in `docs/prompts/unit-tests/` but lack proper documentation integration
- **5-Step Process**: The unit test-specific 5-step generation process is documented in the general writing guide instead of unit-specific guidance
- **Balance**: `INTEGRATION_TESTS.md` provides exceptional depth while unit testing lacks equivalent comprehensive guidance
- **Cross-References**: Missing integration between existing documentation and the new comprehensive integration testing guide

### Improvement Goals
- **Documentation Balance**: Create comprehensive `UNIT_TESTS.md` matching the quality and depth of `INTEGRATION_TESTS.md`
- **Clear Separation**: Establish distinct documentation boundaries between unit, integration, and general testing concepts
- **Content Consolidation**: Move scattered unit testing content into a centralized, comprehensive guide
- **Workflow Integration**: Properly document and integrate AI-assisted unit test development workflows
- **Architectural Completeness**: Create a balanced documentation suite supporting both testing approaches equally

### Desired Outcome
A comprehensive, well-organized testing documentation suite with clear separation of concerns, comprehensive guides for both unit and integration testing, and integrated AI-assisted development workflows that support developers in writing high-quality, behavior-driven tests.
