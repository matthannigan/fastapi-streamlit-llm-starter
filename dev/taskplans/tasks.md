# Tasks

## Task 1: Implement `CacheKeyGenerator` and Integrate into `AIResponseCache`

**Priority:** high     **Status:** pending     **Dependencies:** none

**Description:** Create the `CacheKeyGenerator` class as detailed in the PRD, including `_hash_text_efficiently` and `generate_cache_key` methods. This class should be implemented in `backend/app/services/cache.py` or a new utility file imported by it. Integrate this new generator into the `AIResponseCache` class (in `backend/app/services/cache.py`) by replacing its existing `_generate_cache_key` method logic with calls to an instance of `CacheKeyGenerator`. Ensure `text_hash_threshold` and `hash_algorithm` are appropriately set (e.g., configurable via `backend/app/config.py`).


## Task 2: Implement Tiered Caching Logic in `AIResponseCache`

**Priority:** high     **Status:** pending     **Dependencies:** 1

**Description:** Modify the `AIResponseCache` class in `backend/app/services/cache.py` to implement the tiered caching strategy. This includes adding `text_size_tiers`, `memory_cache`, and `memory_cache_size` attributes. Implement the `_get_text_tier` method and the `_update_memory_cache` method (with simple FIFO/LRU eviction). Update the `get_cached_response` method to check the in-memory cache first for 'small' tier items before querying Redis, and to populate the memory cache for 'small' items on Redis hits, as per the PRD's logic.


## Task 3: Implement Compressed Caching in `AIResponseCache`

**Priority:** high     **Status:** pending     **Dependencies:** 1

**Description:** Enhance the `AIResponseCache` class in `backend/app/services/cache.py` to support compression for large cache entries. Add `compression_threshold` and `compression_level` attributes. Implement the `_compress_data` (using `pickle` and `zlib`) and `_decompress_data` methods as specified in the PRD. Modify `cache_response` to use `_compress_data` before storing data in Redis and `get_cached_response` to use `_decompress_data` after retrieval. Ensure the `cached_response` metadata includes `compression_used`.


## Task 4: Develop `CachePerformanceMonitor` Service

**Priority:** medium     **Status:** pending     **Dependencies:** none

**Description:** Create the `CachePerformanceMonitor` class as specified in the PRD. This class should be placed in a suitable location, e.g., `backend/app/services/monitoring.py` or within `backend/app/services/cache.py`. Implement methods like `record_key_generation_time`, and `get_performance_stats`. Ensure it stores recent measurements (e.g., for the last hour). The PRD also implies attributes for `cache_operation_times` and `compression_ratios`; ensure methods to record these are considered if they are to be actively monitored beyond what `get_performance_stats` currently covers from `key_generation_times`.


## Task 5: Integrate `CachePerformanceMonitor` with Caching Services

**Priority:** medium     **Status:** pending     **Dependencies:** 1, 4

**Description:** Integrate the `CachePerformanceMonitor` with the caching services. Modify `CacheKeyGenerator` (or its usage within `AIResponseCache`) to call `monitor.record_key_generation_time`. Modify `AIResponseCache` to call relevant methods of the `CachePerformanceMonitor` to record cache operation times (e.g., for `get_cached_response`, `cache_response`) and compression statistics (e.g., original vs. compressed size when `_compress_data` is used).


## Task 6: Expose Cache Performance Metrics via API Endpoint

**Priority:** medium     **Status:** pending     **Dependencies:** 4

**Description:** Create a new FastAPI endpoint to expose cache performance statistics. This endpoint should retrieve data using the `CachePerformanceMonitor.get_performance_stats()` method. Consider placing this endpoint in `backend/app/main.py`, a new router (e.g., `backend/app/routers/monitoring.py`), or `backend/app/resilience_endpoints.py`. The endpoint should return a JSON response with metrics like average key generation time, max key generation time, average text length, and total operations.


## Task 7: Unit Tests for New Caching Logic (`CacheKeyGenerator`, `AIResponseCache`)

**Priority:** high     **Status:** pending     **Dependencies:** 1, 2, 3

**Description:** Write comprehensive unit tests for the new caching functionalities in `backend/tests/`. For `CacheKeyGenerator`: test with various text lengths (below/above threshold), different options, and with/without the question parameter. For `AIResponseCache`: test the tiered caching logic (correct tier selection, memory cache usage for 'small' tier, LRU/FIFO eviction), data compression/decompression, and cache hit/miss scenarios across different tiers. Mock Redis interactions as needed.


## Task 8: Unit Tests for `CachePerformanceMonitor` and API Endpoint

**Priority:** medium     **Status:** pending     **Dependencies:** 4, 6

**Description:** Develop unit tests for the `CachePerformanceMonitor` class and the new cache performance API endpoint in `backend/tests/`. For `CachePerformanceMonitor`: test data recording, statistic calculation (averages, max, totals), and time-based data eviction. For the API endpoint: use `FastAPI.TestClient` to test request/response validation and ensure correct data retrieval by mocking the `CachePerformanceMonitor`.


## Task 9: Refactor Existing Code and Update Dependencies/Configuration for New Cache

**Priority:** medium     **Status:** pending     **Dependencies:** 1, 2, 3

**Description:** Review `backend/app/services/cache.py` and other relevant files to remove any old caching logic and ensure seamless integration of the new components. Update `backend/requirements.txt` if any new libraries were effectively added (e.g., if `zlib` or `pickle` usage implies specific environment needs, though they are built-in). Add new configurable parameters (e.g., `TEXT_HASH_THRESHOLD`, `COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD`, `TEXT_SIZE_TIERS`, `MEMORY_CACHE_SIZE`) to `backend/app/config.py` and ensure they are used by the caching services.


## Task 10: Documentation and Best Practices Review for New Caching System

**Priority:** medium     **Status:** pending     **Dependencies:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

**Description:** Update all relevant documentation, including `backend/README.md` and docstrings within the caching-related Python files (`cache.py`, `monitoring.py` if created). The documentation should detail the new caching architecture (key generation, tiered approach, compression), configuration options available in `config.py`, how to use the performance monitoring API endpoint, and any relevant best practices followed or considerations made during implementation.
