# API Exception Handling Refactoring PRD

## Overview  
The current API endpoints do not follow the established custom exception patterns defined in `app.core.exceptions`. Instead, they use FastAPI's `HTTPException` directly, bypassing the sophisticated exception hierarchy designed for resilience, error classification, and consistent error handling across the application.

This refactoring will standardize exception handling across all API endpoints to leverage the custom exception system, improve error consistency, enable proper retry logic through exception classification, and ensure all errors flow through the global exception handler for uniform HTTP response mapping.

**Problem**: 60+ HTTPException instances across 39 API files deviate from established exception patterns, preventing the application from leveraging its resilience infrastructure and causing inconsistent error handling.

**Solution**: Systematically refactor all API endpoints to use custom exceptions (`ValidationError`, `BusinessLogicError`, `InfrastructureError`, etc.) with proper context data and remove direct HTTPException usage.

**Value**: Consistent error handling, improved resilience through retry classification, better debugging with structured context data, and adherence to established architectural patterns.

## Core Features  

### 1. Custom Exception Integration
**What it does**: Replace all direct HTTPException usage with appropriate custom exceptions from the established hierarchy.

**Why it's important**: Enables the application to leverage its sophisticated exception classification system for retry logic, circuit breaker integration, and consistent error responses.

**How it works**: Import custom exceptions in each API module and raise them with proper context data instead of HTTPException. The global exception handler will convert them to appropriate HTTP responses.

### 2. Exception Context Enhancement  
**What it does**: Add structured context data to all custom exception raises to improve debugging and monitoring.

**Why it's important**: Provides detailed error information for logging, monitoring, and troubleshooting while maintaining security by not exposing sensitive data in HTTP responses.

**How it works**: Include relevant context like request IDs, operation types, resource identifiers, and error details in the exception context dictionary.

### 3. Retry Logic Integration
**What it does**: Utilize the `classify_ai_exception()` utility to enable proper retry behavior for transient errors.

**Why it's important**: Improves application resilience by automatically retrying recoverable errors while avoiding retries on permanent failures.

**How it works**: Replace manual retry decision logic with calls to the established exception classification utilities.

### 4. Global Exception Handler Integration
**What it does**: Remove local exception handling in favor of letting the global exception handler process all custom exceptions.

**Why it's important**: Ensures consistent HTTP response format, status code mapping, and error logging across all endpoints.

**How it works**: Let custom exceptions bubble up to be caught by the global exception handler, which uses `get_http_status_for_exception()` for proper HTTP mapping.

### 5. Import Standardization
**What it does**: Standardize imports across all API modules to include necessary custom exceptions.

**Why it's important**: Ensures consistent availability of exception types and follows established import patterns.

**How it works**: Add standard import blocks for custom exceptions in all API modules, removing HTTPException imports where no longer needed.

## User Experience  

### Developer Personas
- **Backend Developers**: Need consistent exception patterns for maintaining and extending API endpoints
- **DevOps Engineers**: Require predictable error formats for monitoring and alerting systems  
- **Frontend Developers**: Benefit from consistent error response structures across all API endpoints

### Key Developer Flows
1. **API Development**: Developers can focus on business logic knowing exception handling follows established patterns
2. **Error Debugging**: Structured context data provides clear debugging information without exposing sensitive details
3. **Monitoring Integration**: Consistent exception classification enables automated retry logic and alerting thresholds

### Implementation Experience Considerations
- Maintain backward compatibility for HTTP response formats during transition
- Ensure error messages remain clear and actionable for API consumers
- Preserve existing logging patterns while enhancing with structured context data

## Technical Architecture  

### System Components
- **Custom Exception Hierarchy**: Already established in `app.core.exceptions` with `ApplicationError`, `InfrastructureError`, and specialized AI service exceptions
- **Global Exception Handler**: Existing FastAPI exception handler that converts custom exceptions to HTTP responses
- **Exception Classification Utilities**: `classify_ai_exception()` and `get_http_status_for_exception()` for consistent behavior
- **API Endpoint Modules**: 39 files across `/api/internal/` and `/api/v1/` directories requiring refactoring

### Data Models
- **Exception Context**: Dictionary containing structured error information (request_id, operation, resource identifiers, error details)
- **HTTP Response Mapping**: Standardized mapping from custom exceptions to HTTP status codes via `get_http_status_for_exception()`
- **Error Classification**: Boolean classification of exceptions for retry logic via `classify_ai_exception()`

### APIs and Integrations
- **Resilience Infrastructure**: Integration with circuit breakers and retry mechanisms through exception classification  
- **Monitoring Systems**: Enhanced error tracking through structured context data
- **Logging Framework**: Consistent log format across all exception types

### Infrastructure Requirements
- No new infrastructure required - leverages existing exception handling system
- Maintains current FastAPI application structure and global exception handler
- Preserves existing API endpoint signatures and response formats

3. **Testing Framework**: Essential for validating refactored exception handling before proceeding
4. **Documentation**: Critical for maintaining consistency across remaining phases

### Build Upon Foundation (Phase 2-3)  
5. **Remaining Internal APIs**: Apply established patterns to simpler internal APIs
6. **Public API Enhancement**: Leverage learnings from internal API refactoring to enhance public APIs
7. **Pattern Validation**: Ensure consistency across all API modules before final testing

### Validation and Completion (Phase 4)
8. **Integration Testing**: Test complete exception handling system end-to-end
9. **Performance Validation**: Ensure refactoring doesn't impact system performance  
10. **Monitoring Enhancement**: Validate improved error tracking and alerting capabilities

### Getting to Usable State Quickly
- **Immediate Value**: Phase 1 delivers immediate value by refactoring the most complex APIs (resilience and cache)
- **Pattern Establishment**: Early phases establish clear patterns that accelerate later phases
- **Incremental Testing**: Each phase includes testing to ensure system stability throughout refactoring

### Atomic but Buildable Features
- Each API module can be refactored independently within a phase
- Exception patterns established in early modules inform and accelerate later modules
- Testing and documentation components support all refactoring work
- Each phase delivers complete, usable functionality that can be deployed independently

## Risks and Mitigations  

### Technical Challenges
**Risk**: Introducing regressions in error handling during refactoring

### Technical Specifications

#### Exception Import Pattern
```python
from app.core.exceptions import (
    ValidationError,
    BusinessLogicError, 
    InfrastructureError,
    AuthenticationError,
    AuthorizationError
)
```

#### Exception Usage Pattern  
```python
# Instead of:
raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid configuration")

# Use:
raise ValidationError(
    "Invalid configuration format", 
    context={
        "endpoint": "config_validation",
        "request_id": request_id,
        "config_type": config_type
    }
)
```

#### Context Data Standards
- Always include `request_id` when available
- Include `endpoint` or `operation` identifier  
- Add relevant resource identifiers
- Include error details without exposing sensitive data
- Use consistent key naming across all endpoints
