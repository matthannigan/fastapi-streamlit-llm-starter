# Redis Operational Excellence PRD

## Overview

Building on Phase 1's critical security foundation (encryption, network isolation, monitoring), this PRD focuses on making Redis security **operationally excellent** for teams adopting the FastAPI-Streamlit-LLM Starter Template. While Phase 1 secured the infrastructure, Phase 2 makes security **visible, manageable, and maintainable** through automated ACL management, integrated dashboards, and comprehensive operational documentation.

**Problem**: Teams now have secure Redis infrastructure but lack operational tools to manage security at scale, visibility into security posture, and guidance for ongoing security maintenance - creating operational overhead and potential security drift over time.

**Target Users**: 
- **Operations teams** maintaining production deployments of the starter template
- **Security-conscious developers** needing ongoing security visibility  
- **Team leads** requiring security compliance reporting and audit trails
- **DevOps engineers** scaling secure deployments across environments

**Value Proposition**: Transforms secure Redis infrastructure into an **operationally excellent security platform** with automated management, real-time visibility, and comprehensive operational guidance.

## Core Features

### 1. Automated ACL Management System
**What it does**: Provides automated Redis ACL user creation, permission management, and rotation utilities.

**Why it's important**: Eliminates manual ACL configuration errors, enforces principle of least privilege, and enables secure multi-service architectures.

**How it works**:
```python
# ACL automation integrated with existing SecurityConfig
class RedisACLManager:
    """Production ACL management with automated user lifecycle"""
    
    def __init__(self, redis_client, security_config: SecurityConfig):
        self.redis = redis_client
        self.config = security_config
        self.service_users = {
            "ai_cache": {
                "permissions": ["+@read", "+@write", "+@string", "+@hash", "-@dangerous"],
                "key_patterns": ["ai_cache:*", "ai_response:*"],
                "description": "AI response caching service"
            },
            "health_monitor": {
                "permissions": ["+ping", "+info", "+memory", "-@dangerous"],
                "key_patterns": ["health:*"],
                "description": "Health monitoring service"
            },
            "session_store": {
                "permissions": ["+@read", "+@write", "+@string", "-@dangerous"],
                "key_patterns": ["session:*", "user:*"],
                "description": "User session storage"
            }
        }
    
    async def setup_production_users(self) -> Dict[str, str]:
        """Create all production users with generated passwords"""
        created_users = {}
        
        for username, config in self.service_users.items():
            password = self._generate_service_password()
            await self._create_acl_user(username, password, config)
            created_users[username] = password
            logger.info(f"Created ACL user: {username}")
            
        return created_users
    
    async def rotate_user_credentials(self, username: str) -> str:
        """Rotate credentials for specific user"""
        new_password = self._generate_service_password()
        await self._update_user_password(username, new_password)
        return new_password
```

### 2. Security Dashboard Integration  
**What it does**: Integrates Redis security status and metrics into the existing Streamlit frontend.

**Why it's important**: Provides real-time security visibility for operations teams without requiring separate tools or complex queries.

**How it works**:
```python
# Integration with existing Streamlit app
def render_security_dashboard():
    """Add security panel to existing Streamlit interface"""
    
    with st.sidebar:
        st.subheader("🔒 Redis Security")
        
        # Get security status from existing cache service
        security_status = get_cache_security_status()
        
        if security_status['overall_secure']:
            st.success("✅ Secure")
            st.metric("Security Score", f"{security_status['score']}/100")
        else:
            st.error("⚠️ Security Issues")
            with st.expander("View Issues"):
                for issue in security_status['issues']:
                    st.warning(f"• {issue}")
        
        # Security metrics alongside existing performance metrics
        with st.expander("Security Metrics"):
            col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
            with col1:
                st.metric("Auth Failures (24h)", security_status['auth_failures'])
                st.metric("Active Sessions", security_status['active_sessions'])
            with col2:
                st.metric("Encryption Status", "✅" if security_status['encrypted'] else "❌")
                st.metric("Network Isolated", "✅" if security_status['isolated'] else "❌")
```

### 3. Security Compliance Reporting
**What it does**: Generates automated security compliance reports and audit trails for Redis infrastructure.

**Why it's important**: Enables teams to demonstrate security compliance, track security posture over time, and meet audit requirements.

**How it works**:
```python
class SecurityComplianceReporter:
    """Generate security compliance reports for audit and governance"""
    
    def __init__(self, cache_service, security_manager: RedisCacheSecurityManager):
        self.cache = cache_service
        self.security_manager = security_manager
        
    async def generate_compliance_report(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Generate comprehensive security compliance report"""
        
        # Collect security configuration status
        security_status = await self.security_manager.validate_connection_security()
        
        # Collect operational metrics
        cache_stats = await self.cache.get_cache_stats()
        
        # Analyze security events
        security_events = self._analyze_security_events()
        
        return {
            "report_timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "security_configuration": {
                "authentication_enabled": security_status.has_authentication,
                "encryption_in_transit": security_status.tls_enabled,
                "encryption_at_rest": security_status.data_encrypted,
                "network_isolation": security_status.network_isolated,
                "security_level": security_status.security_level
            },
            "operational_security": {
                "total_auth_attempts": security_events["auth_attempts"],
                "failed_auth_attempts": security_events["auth_failures"],
                "auth_success_rate": security_events["auth_success_rate"],
                "security_alerts_triggered": security_events["alerts"]
            },
            "compliance_status": self._assess_compliance_status(security_status),
            "recommendations": self._generate_security_recommendations(security_status)
        }
```

### 4. Operational Security Documentation
**What it does**: Provides comprehensive operational runbooks, security playbooks, and troubleshooting guides.

**Why it's important**: Enables teams to maintain security over time, respond to security incidents, and onboard new team members effectively.

**How it works**:
```markdown
# docs/security/
├── SECURITY_OPERATIONS.md      # Day-to-day security operations
├── INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md        # Security incident response procedures  
├── COMPLIANCE_GUIDE.md         # Compliance requirements and validation

        # Create cache with service-specific credentials
        cache_config = {**base_config}
        cache_config['security_config'] = SecurityConfig(
            acl_username="ai_cache",
            acl_password=service_credentials["ai_cache"],
            **security_config.__dict__
        )
        
        cache = await cls.create_cache_from_config(cache_config)
        
        return cache, service_credentials
```
