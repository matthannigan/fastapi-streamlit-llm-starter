# Redis Critical Security Gaps Implementation Task Plan

## Context and Rationale

The FastAPI-Streamlit-LLM Starter project currently operates Redis with critical security vulnerabilities: no authentication, unencrypted data transmission and storage, exposed network ports, and missing security monitoring. The Redis Critical Security Gaps Implementation addresses these vulnerabilities through a comprehensive security enhancement strategy as specified in the PRD at `dev/taskplans/pending/redis-critical-security-gaps_PRD.md`.

### Identified Security Gaps
- **No Redis Authentication**: Redis accepts connections without password verification
- **Unencrypted Data**: Sensitive AI responses stored and transmitted in plain text
- **Network Exposure**: Redis port 6379 exposed on all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
- **No Security Monitoring**: Authentication failures and security events not tracked
- **Weak Configuration**: Missing environment-aware secure configuration generation

### Improvement Goals
- **Data-at-Rest Encryption**: Implement Fernet encryption for all cached AI responses
- **Network Isolation**: Configure Docker internal networks with no external exposure
- **Security Monitoring**: Integrate security events with existing CachePerformanceMonitor
- **Automated Configuration**: Environment-aware secure credential generation
- **Zero-Trust Security**: Production-grade authentication and encryption by default

### Desired Outcome
A production-ready Redis deployment with application-layer encryption, network isolation, comprehensive security monitoring, and environment-aware configuration that maintains backward compatibility while providing fail-fast production security validation.
