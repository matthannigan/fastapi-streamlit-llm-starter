# Overview  
This PRD outlines the systematic improvement of test coverage for the main.py FastAPI application module. Currently, while basic functionality is well-tested, there are significant gaps in testing edge cases, error scenarios, configuration validation, logging behavior, and integration points. The goal is to achieve comprehensive test coverage that ensures robustness, maintainability, and confidence in the application's behavior under all conditions.

**Problem**: The current test suite for main.py has approximately 15 major coverage gaps including lifespan management, global exception handling, enhanced health checks, comprehensive CORS testing, request tracing, logging validation, and various edge cases.

**Target Audience**: Development team, QA engineers, and DevOps teams who need confidence in the application's reliability and behavior.

**Value**: Comprehensive test coverage will reduce production bugs, improve code maintainability, enable safer refactoring, and provide clear documentation of expected behavior through tests.

# Core Features  

## 1. Application Lifespan Testing

## 2. Global Exception Handler Testing  
**What it does**: Validates the global exception handler catches unhandled exceptions and returns proper error responses.
**Why it's important**: Prevents application crashes and ensures consistent error response format.
**How it works**: Trigger various unhandled exceptions and verify logging, response format, and HTTP status codes.

## 3. Enhanced Health Check Testing
**What it does**: Tests health endpoint integration with resilience service status reporting.
**Why it's important**: Provides accurate system health status for monitoring and load balancing.
**How it works**: Mock resilience service states and verify health response accuracy.

## 4. Comprehensive CORS Validation
**What it does**: Tests CORS middleware configuration and behavior comprehensively.
**Why it's important**: Ensures proper cross-origin request handling and security compliance.
**How it works**: Validate allowed origins, methods, headers, and preflight request handling.

## 5. Request Tracing and Logging Validation
**What it does**: Tests request ID generation, logging patterns, and API key masking.
**Why it's important**: Ensures proper request tracing, debugging capability, and security compliance.
**How it works**: Verify UUID generation, log message formats, and sensitive data protection.

## 6. Error Handling Edge Cases
**What it does**: Tests specific error scenarios and exception handling paths.
**Why it's important**: Ensures graceful error handling and proper user feedback.
**How it works**: Trigger ValueError, generic exceptions, and various error conditions.

## 7. Settings and Dependency Integration Testing
**What it does**: Tests configuration loading, dependency injection, and service integration.
**Why it's important**: Validates proper application configuration and service wiring.
**How it works**: Mock different configuration scenarios and verify behavior.

## 8. Middleware Stack Testing
**What it does**: Tests middleware order, interaction, and behavior.
**Why it's important**: Ensures proper request/response processing pipeline.
**How it works**: Verify middleware execution order and interaction with other components.
