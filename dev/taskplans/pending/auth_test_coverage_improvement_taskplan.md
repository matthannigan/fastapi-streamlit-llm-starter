# Auth Test Coverage Improvement Task Plan

## Context and Rationale

The authentication module (`backend/app/infrastructure/security/auth.py`) currently has substantial test coverage for core authentication flows but contains critical gaps in testing utility functions, advanced features, and edge cases. Based on the PRD analysis, current coverage is approximately 75% for line coverage but missing critical functional coverage for utility functions, metadata handling, runtime configuration management, and security edge cases.

### Identified Gaps
- **Utility Functions**: `get_auth_status()`, `is_development_mode()`, and `supports_feature()` have zero test coverage.
- **Advanced Features**: Feature flag combinations, runtime configuration changes, and metadata systems are largely untested.
- **Edge Cases**: Unicode handling, performance limits, security scenarios, and malformed inputs lack proper testing.
- **Runtime Management**: `reload_keys()`, environment variable changes, and dynamic configuration need comprehensive testing.
- **Security Validation**: Timing attacks, key exposure, and vulnerability scenarios are not covered.

### Improvement Goals
- **Coverage**: Achieve 95%+ line and branch coverage for the auth module.
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive testing of all authentication scenarios to prevent production failures.
- **Maintainability**: Clear, well-documented test structure that's easy to understand and extend.
- **Security**: Robust testing of security edge cases and potential vulnerability scenarios.

### Desired Outcome
A comprehensive test suite for the authentication module that covers all functionality, from basic utility functions to advanced security scenarios, with proper isolation, clear documentation, and high maintainability.
