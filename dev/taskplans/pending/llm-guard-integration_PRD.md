## Narrative

Sarah, a startup CTO, inherited an AI-powered customer service platform with custom-built security that's becoming increasingly difficult to maintain. Every week brings new attack vectors—prompt injections, data leakage attempts, and toxic content generation—that their small security implementation struggles to catch. When a security researcher publicly demonstrates bypassing their custom filters, Sarah realizes they need enterprise-grade protection immediately.

The LLM-Guard integration transforms their security posture overnight. Sarah's team simply updates their environment configuration, and suddenly their application benefits from battle-tested detection models maintained by security experts worldwide. During development, they run everything locally with full transparency into security decisions and comprehensive performance monitoring. The ONNX optimization provides enterprise-grade performance while keeping costs predictable. The architecture is designed to support future ProtectAI SaaS integration when needed, requiring only a configuration change without code modifications.

The comprehensive dashboard gives Sarah visibility she never had before—seeing exactly what attacks are being blocked, understanding performance impacts, and generating compliance reports that satisfy their enterprise customers' security requirements. Most importantly, her engineering team can focus on building great AI experiences instead of chasing the latest security vulnerabilities. The result: 95% fewer security incidents, 60% faster feature development, and the confidence to pursue enterprise deals that require rigorous security standards.
