# Overview  
This PRD outlines the systematic improvement of test coverage for the main.py FastAPI application module following the recent backend refactoring. The refactoring introduced a sophisticated dual-app architecture with enhanced separation between public and internal APIs, but created new testing challenges around application lifecycle management, custom documentation features, and security-aware behaviors. While basic endpoint functionality is tested, critical architectural components remain untested.

**Problem**: The current test suite for main.py has approximately 8-10 major coverage gaps focused on the dual-app architecture, including lifespan management, app mounting/separation, custom OpenAPI schema generation, production security behaviors, and sophisticated documentation features.

**Target Audience**: Development team, QA engineers, and DevOps teams who need confidence in the dual-app architecture's reliability and security behaviors.

**Value**: Comprehensive test coverage will ensure the sophisticated architecture works correctly across environments, validate security features, reduce production bugs, and provide clear documentation of expected behavior through tests.

# Core Features  

## 1. Dual-App Architecture Testing
**What it does**: Tests the creation and separation of public (`create_public_app()`) and internal (`create_internal_app()`) FastAPI applications.
**Why it's important**: Ensures proper isolation between public and administrative APIs, validates mounting at `/internal`, and confirms independent configuration.
**How it works**: Test app creation functions, verify endpoint isolation, test mounted app behavior, and validate independent middleware/configuration.
**Code Location**: `app/main.py:385-521` (create_public_app), `app/main.py:524-631` (create_internal_app), `app/main.py:641` (mounting)

## 2. Application Lifespan Testing
**What it does**: Tests the async lifespan context manager that handles startup and shutdown events with comprehensive logging.
**Why it's important**: Ensures proper application initialization, configuration logging, and graceful shutdown behavior.
**How it works**: Mock lifespan events and verify startup logging (debug mode, AI model, docs URLs) and shutdown cleanup.
**Code Location**: `app/main.py:296-338` (lifespan function)

## 3. Custom OpenAPI Schema Generation Testing
**What it does**: Tests the custom OpenAPI schema generation that removes default validation error schemas while preserving application-specific schemas.
**Why it's important**: Ensures clean API documentation without FastAPI's default schemas and validates schema customization logic.
**How it works**: Test schema generation, verify removal of unwanted schemas, validate preservation of custom schemas, and test debug logging.
**Code Location**: `app/main.py:340-383` (custom_openapi_schema function)

## 4. Production Security Behavior Testing
**What it does**: Tests that internal API documentation and OpenAPI schemas are properly disabled in production mode.
**Why it's important**: Ensures security compliance by hiding administrative endpoints and documentation in production environments.
**How it works**: Test with `settings.debug=False` and verify 404 responses for internal docs, disabled OpenAPI endpoints, and proper error handling.
**Code Location**: `app/main.py:572-575` (internal app openapi/redoc), `app/main.py:583-591` (internal docs endpoint)

## 5. Custom Swagger UI and Navigation Testing
**What it does**: Tests the custom Swagger UI with navigation between public and internal APIs.
**Why it's important**: Ensures proper documentation experience and validates custom HTML generation with API navigation.
**How it works**: Test custom HTML generation, verify navigation button functionality, validate proper API type detection, and test production restrictions.
**Code Location**: `app/main.py:204-294` (get_custom_swagger_ui_html), `app/main.py:433-442` (public docs), `app/main.py:580-591` (internal docs)

## 6. Utility Redirects Testing
**What it does**: Tests legacy compatibility redirects for `/health` and `/auth/status` endpoints.
**Why it's important**: Ensures backward compatibility for monitoring systems and validates proper redirect headers and status codes.
**How it works**: Test redirect responses, verify 301 status codes, validate redirect headers (Location, X-API-Version, X-Endpoint-Type).
**Code Location**: `app/main.py:489-513` (health and auth status redirects)

## 7. Application Configuration and Logging Testing
**What it does**: Tests logging configuration, middleware setup, and settings integration across both apps.
**Why it's important**: Validates proper logging levels, middleware application, and configuration loading for dual-app architecture.
**How it works**: Test logging configuration, middleware setup differences, settings validation, and environment-specific behavior.
**Code Location**: `app/main.py:192-202` (logging setup), `app/main.py:431` (middleware setup)

## 8. Internal API Router Integration Testing
**What it does**: Tests the comprehensive integration of all internal API routers including resilience, monitoring, and cache endpoints.
**Why it's important**: Ensures all administrative endpoints are properly registered and accessible within the internal app.
**How it works**: Test router inclusion, verify endpoint availability, validate authentication requirements, and test router-specific functionality.
**Code Location**: `app/main.py:614-627` (internal router inclusion)

- Use parametrized tests for different environment configurations (`debug=True/False`, different log levels)
- Maintain 90%+ code coverage for main.py module (currently ~60% estimated)
- Include both positive and negative test cases for all architectural components
- Test both public and internal app behaviors separately and in integration
