# Main.py Test Coverage Improvement Task Plan

## Context and Rationale

The main.py FastAPI application module has undergone significant refactoring that introduced a sophisticated dual-app architecture with enhanced separation between public and internal APIs. While basic endpoint functionality exists (tested in `tests/api/v1/test_main_endpoints.py`), critical architectural components remain completely untested. Based on the PRD analysis, the current test coverage for main.py has 8-10 major gaps focused on the dual-app architecture, lifespan management, custom documentation features, and security-aware behaviors.

### Identified Coverage Gaps
- **Dual-App Architecture**: `create_public_app()`, `create_internal_app()`, and mounting logic have zero test coverage.
- **Application Lifespan**: `lifespan()` async context manager with comprehensive logging is untested.
- **Custom OpenAPI Schema Generation**: `custom_openapi_schema()` function for schema cleanup is untested.
- **Production Security Behaviors**: Internal API documentation disabled in production mode is untested.
- **Custom Swagger UI**: `get_custom_swagger_ui_html()` with navigation between APIs is untested.
- **Utility Redirects**: `/health` and `/auth/status` redirect endpoints have no specific coverage.
- **Internal Router Integration**: Comprehensive resilience router inclusion and mounting is untested.
- **Configuration and Logging**: Environment-aware configuration and logging setup lacks proper testing.

### Improvement Goals
- **Coverage**: Achieve 90%+ line and branch coverage for main.py module (currently estimated at ~50-60%).
- **Architecture Confidence**: Comprehensive testing of dual-app architecture and separation mechanisms.
- **Security Validation**: Ensure production security behaviors work correctly across environments.
- **Integration Assurance**: Validate proper integration of all routers and middleware across both apps.

### Desired Outcome
A comprehensive test suite for the main.py module that validates the sophisticated dual-app architecture, custom documentation features, security behaviors, and lifecycle management, providing confidence in the application's reliability and maintainability.
