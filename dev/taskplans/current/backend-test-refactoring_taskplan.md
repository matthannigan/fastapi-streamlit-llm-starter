# Backend Test Refactoring Task Plan

## Context and Rationale

The FastAPI backend test suite requires comprehensive reorganization to align with the project's contract-driven, behavior-focused testing philosophy. The analysis documented in `dev/taskplans/current/backend-test-refactoring_analysis.md` revealed that while the project has excellent testing assets, they suffer from classification issues rather than quality problems. Currently, 58% of tests in `backend/tests/api/` should be relocated to `integration/`, 25% should move to `unit/`, and 17% should be discarded and rewritten. Additionally, several tests labeled as "integration" are actually API endpoint tests or E2E tests, highlighting the critical need for proper test classification.

### Identified Test Organization Issues
- **Misclassified Integration Tests**: `test_resilience_integration1.py` is actually an API endpoint test testing HTTP routing with heavy mocking.
- **Proper Integration Tests Misplaced**: High-quality integration tests like `test_text_processing_endpoints.py` are in the API directory.
- **E2E Tests in Wrong Location**: `test_end_to_end.py` tests deployment scenarios but is classified as integration.
- **Valuable Legacy Patterns**: `tests.old/` contains excellent concurrent authentication and edge case testing patterns.
- **Incomplete Stubs**: Multiple files with TODO comments instead of actual implementations.
- **Mixed Test Concerns**: Tests combining API contract testing with integration patterns, reducing clarity and maintainability.

### Improvement Goals
- **Proper Test Classification**: Establish clear boundaries between unit, integration, E2E, and manual tests.
- **Pattern Preservation**: Extract and preserve excellent behavioral testing patterns from legacy tests.
- **Enhanced Integration**: Merge valuable testing patterns while eliminating incomplete stubs.
- **Behavioral Focus**: Strengthen contract-driven testing approach throughout the suite.

### Desired Outcome
A properly organized test suite with clear test type boundaries, preserved excellent behavioral patterns, enhanced integration testing capabilities, and eliminated incomplete implementations, all aligned with the project's contract-driven testing philosophy.
