# Environment-Aware Authentication Enforcement PRD

## Overview

The FastAPI-Streamlit-LLM Starter Template includes comprehensive security infrastructure including security headers, authentication validation, and development mode detection. However, it lacks environment-aware authentication enforcement that could prevent accidental production deployments without proper security configuration.

**Problem**: While the current authentication system (`app/infrastructure/security/auth.py`) provides excellent development experience with automatic development mode detection, it lacks production environment detection and fail-fast validation. This creates a risk where production deployments could accidentally allow unauthenticated access if API keys are not properly configured.

**Current Security State**: 
- ✅ Comprehensive security headers via `SecurityMiddleware` 
- ✅ Multi-API key authentication with clear error messages
- ✅ Development mode detection and warnings
- ❌ **Missing**: Production environment detection and mandatory authentication enforcement

**Target Users**: 
- DevOps engineers deploying AI applications to production
- Development teams needing clear production readiness validation
- Organizations requiring fail-fast security validation

**Value Proposition**: Adds the final missing piece to the security infrastructure by preventing accidental production deployments without authentication, while preserving the excellent existing development experience.

## Core Features

### 1. Environment Detection and Classification
**What it does**: Automatically detects deployment environment (development, staging, production) through multiple signals and environmental cues.

**Why it's needed**: The current system lacks environment awareness, which is the foundation for secure production deployments.

**How it works**: 
- Environment detection through explicit `ENVIRONMENT` variable
- Host pattern matching for production domains
- Configuration analysis for production-grade settings
- Support for `ENFORCE_AUTH=true` override for staging environments

### 2. Production Authentication Enforcement
**What it does**: Extends the existing authentication system (`app/infrastructure/security/auth.py`) with mandatory authentication for production environments.

**Why it's needed**: Current development mode bypass could accidentally allow unauthenticated access in production.

**How it works**:
- Enhances existing `verify_api_key()` function with environment awareness
- Startup validation that fails fast if API keys not configured in production
- Preserves existing development mode functionality
- Clear error messages guide production configuration

### 3. Internal API Production Protection
**What it does**: Automatically disables internal documentation and administrative endpoints in production environments.

**Why it's needed**: Internal endpoints (`/internal/docs`) should not be exposed in production deployments.

**How it works**:
- Builds on existing main.py dual-API architecture
- Environment-aware documentation endpoint enablement
- Production-safe administrative endpoint access

## User Experience

### User Personas

**DevOps Engineer (Primary)**
- Needs: Secure production deployments, clear configuration requirements, deployment confidence
- Pain Points: Unclear security requirements, deployment failures due to misconfiguration
- Goals: Zero-surprise deployments, clear security validation, operational confidence

**Application Developer (Secondary)**
- Needs: Productive development workflow, clear security feedback, easy testing
- Pain Points: Security complexity breaking development flow, unclear error messages
- Goals: Frictionless local development, clear security guidance, smooth production deployment

### Key User Flows

#### 1. Production Deployment Flow (DevOps Engineer)
```
1. Deploy to production → 2. Environment auto-detection → 3. Security validation → 
4. Configuration check → 5. Clear pass/fail result → 6. Secure operation or helpful error
```

#### 2. Development Setup Flow (Application Developer)
```
1. Local setup → 2. Development mode detection → 3. Security warnings displayed → 
4. Normal development workflow → 5. Production readiness check → 6. Deployment guidance
```

### UI/UX Considerations

- **Clear Security Status**: Obvious indicators of current security mode
- **Helpful Error Messages**: Specific guidance when security validation fails
- **Zero-Config Defaults**: Secure defaults requiring minimal additional setup
- **Progressive Security**: Easy path from development to production security

## Technical Architecture

### Building on Existing Infrastructure

The implementation builds directly on the existing security infrastructure without replacing it:

```python
# Existing Infrastructure (Keep as-is)
├── app/infrastructure/security/auth.py      # APIKeyAuth, verify_api_key()
├── app/core/middleware.py                   # SecurityMiddleware, headers
├── app/core/config.py                       # Settings configuration
└── app/main.py                             # Dual API setup

# New Components (Add to existing)
├── app/core/environment.py                 # NEW: EnvironmentDetector
├── app/core/config.py                      # EXTEND: Production validation  
├── app/infrastructure/security/auth.py     # EXTEND: Environment-aware auth
└── app/main.py                             # EXTEND: Production docs control
```

### Environment Detection Strategy

#### Environment Signals
1. **Explicit Environment Variables**: `ENVIRONMENT=production`
2. **Host Pattern Matching**: Production domain patterns
3. **Configuration Validation**: Presence of production-grade settings
4. **Security Flag Override**: `ENFORCE_AUTH=true` for staging environments

#### Security Mode Matrix
| Environment | Auth Required | Security Headers | Development Warnings |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Development | Optional*     | Basic            | Visible             |
| Staging     | Required      | Full             | None                |
| Production  | Required      | Full             | None                |

*With clear warnings and production readiness checks

### Implementation Details

#### Environment Detection (New Component)
```python
# app/core/environment.py
class EnvironmentDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.environment = self._detect_environment()
        self.enforce_auth = os.getenv("ENFORCE_AUTH", "false").lower() == "true"
    
    def _detect_environment(self) -> str:
        """Detect deployment environment through multiple signals"""
        # Explicit environment variable (highest priority)
        explicit_env = os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT", "").lower()
        if explicit_env in ["production", "staging", "development"]:
            return explicit_env
            
        # Host pattern detection
        hostname = os.getenv("HOSTNAME", "").lower()
        if any(prod_pattern in hostname for prod_pattern in ["prod", "api.", "www."]):
            return "production"
            
        # Configuration-based detection
        if os.getenv("API_KEY") and not os.getenv("DEBUG", "false").lower() == "true":
            return "production"
            
        return "development"
    
    def is_production(self) -> bool:
        """Check if running in production environment"""
        return self.environment == "production" or self.enforce_auth
    
    def requires_auth(self) -> bool:
        """Determine if authentication is required"""
        return self.environment in ["production", "staging"] or self.enforce_auth
```

#### Enhanced Auth Integration (Extend Existing)
```python
# Extensions to app/infrastructure/security/auth.py
from app.core.environment import EnvironmentDetector

# Add to existing APIKeyAuth class:
def __init__(self, auth_config: Optional[AuthConfig] = None):
    self.config = auth_config or AuthConfig()
    self.environment = EnvironmentDetector()  # NEW
    self._key_metadata: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = {}
    self.api_keys = self._load_api_keys()
    
    # NEW: Production validation
    self._validate_production_security()

def _validate_production_security(self):
    """Validate security configuration for production"""
    if self.environment.is_production() and not self.api_keys:
        raise ConfigurationError(
            "Production deployment requires API keys. Set API_KEY environment variable."
        )

# Extend existing verify_api_key function:
async def verify_api_key(credentials: Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials] = Depends(security)) -> str:
    # NEW: Environment-aware validation
    if api_key_auth.environment.requires_auth() and not api_key_auth.api_keys:
        raise AuthenticationError(
            "Authentication required in this environment but no API keys configured"
        )
    
    # Keep existing logic for development mode
    if not api_key_auth.api_keys and not api_key_auth.environment.requires_auth():
        logger.warning("Development mode: allowing unauthenticated access")
        return "development"
    
    # ... rest of existing function unchanged
```

## Risks and Mitigations

### Implementation Risks

**Risk**: Breaking existing development workflows
**Mitigation**: Zero API changes to existing `auth.py`, comprehensive testing with existing test suite

**Risk**: False positive environment detection
**Mitigation**: Conservative defaults (assume development unless explicitly production), clear logging, `ENFORCE_AUTH` override

**Risk**: Production deployments accidentally failing
**Mitigation**: Clear error messages, documentation updates, fail-fast with helpful guidance

### Deployment Risks

**Risk**: Existing production deployments breaking after update
**Mitigation**: Environment detection defaults to permissive behavior, explicit opt-in for strict mode

**Risk**: Team confusion about new environment variables
**Mitigation**: Integration with existing CLAUDE.md documentation, clear migration guide

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: Environment detection reliability
**Mitigation**: Simple detection strategies building on existing configuration patterns, extensive testing

**Risk**: Integration conflicts with existing middleware
**Mitigation**: Build on existing `SecurityMiddleware` in `app/core/middleware.py`, no new middleware stack
