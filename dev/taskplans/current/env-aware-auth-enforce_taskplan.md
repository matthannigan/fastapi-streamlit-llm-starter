# Environment Detection Service Integration Task Plan

## Context and Rationale

The FastAPI-Streamlit-LLM Starter project currently has fragmented environment detection logic duplicated across cache presets (85 lines), resilience presets (75 lines), and lacks production-ready authentication enforcement. The Environment Detection Service Integration addresses multiple critical needs: eliminating 160+ lines of duplicate code across infrastructure services, implementing fail-fast production authentication enforcement as specified in the PRD, and establishing a unified foundation for environment-aware infrastructure configuration.

The existing infrastructure services already contain sophisticated environment detection patterns, but each implements its own logic independently. The Unified Environment Detection Service (`backend/contracts/core/environment.pyi`) provides a production-ready consolidation of these patterns with enhanced confidence scoring, feature-specific context, and consistent behavior across all services.

### Identified Integration Opportunities
- **Cache Preset System**: Currently implements 85-line `_auto_detect_environment()` method that can be replaced with 3-line unified service call
- **Resilience Preset System**: Currently implements 75-line `_auto_detect_environment()` method with similar logic patterns
- **Security Authentication**: Missing production environment detection and fail-fast validation (PRD requirement)
- **Internal API Protection**: Needs environment-aware documentation endpoint control (PRD requirement)
- **Configuration Consistency**: Different services use different detection confidence thresholds and reasoning

### Improvement Goals
- **Code Reduction**: Replace 160+ lines of duplicate detection logic with unified service calls
- **PRD Implementation**: Enable production authentication enforcement and internal API protection
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Consistent environment detection with confidence scoring across all services
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for environment detection logic

### Desired Outcome
A unified environment detection service fully integrated across cache, resilience, and security infrastructure, with production-ready authentication enforcement, internal API protection, and 94% reduction in environment detection code duplication while maintaining full backward compatibility.
