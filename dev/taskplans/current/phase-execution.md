# Taskplan Execution Request

I'm ready to execute Phases 1-3 as detailed in `dev/taskplans/current/llm-guard-integration_taskplan.md` using @agent-taskplan-manager as an orchestrator and multiple, independent @agent-deliverable-execution-agent as workers. Please assign a new @agent-deliverable-execution-agent to each numbered Deliverable. Where possible, assign subagents to operate in parallel.
