# Phase 2 Deliverables 3 & 4 Execution Request

I'm ready to execute Phase 2 Deliverables 3 & 4 as detailed in `dev/taskplans/current/backend-test-refactoring_taskplan.md`. For each numbered Deliverable, please follow this structured approach:

## 🔍 Pre-Execution Analysis

1. **Review Task Plan**: Read each specific deliverable section in the task file to understand:
  - All tasks and subtasks for this deliverable
  - Dependencies that must be satisfied
  - Quality criteria and acceptance requirements
  - Technical specifications and implementation notes
  - Tasks that have already been completed

## 📋 Progress Tracking & Quality

2. **Real-Time Task Completion Tracking**:
  - **MANDATORY PATTERN**: Complete subtask → Update task file → Verify → Continue
  - Mark each completed subtask with `[X]` in the original task file IMMEDIATELY after completion
  - **Maximum batch size**: Update task file after every 2-3 subtasks (never more)
  - Use Edit tool to change `[ ]` to `[X]` and add any implementation notes
  - **Verification step**: Read back the updated section to confirm changes applied
  - **Progress reporting**: Provide brief status after each completed deliverable

## 🎯 Deliverable Completion

3. **Final Validation**:
  - Verify all subtasks are marked complete `[X]`
  - Confirm all quality criteria are satisfied
  - Run any specified tests or validation scripts
  - Check that the deliverable properly enables subsequent work

4. **Handoff**:
  - Add any notes for the next deliverable or team members
  - Prepare context for the next deliverable in the sequence

**Ready to proceed with Phase 2 Deliverables 3 & 4 execution using this structured approach.**
