Based on a thorough review of your testing philosophy and the provided code, your test suite is largely well-structured and aligned with your goals. The primary recommendations are to **reclassify** the `e2e/cache` and `manual` tests to their correct categories and **refactor** one key integration test that violates the principle of not mocking internal collaborators.

The `e2e/cache` tests are excellent examples of high-fidelity **integration tests** and should be moved. The `manual/test_manual_api.py` is a well-written automated test that makes real external network calls, fitting the exact definition of an **E2E test**, and should be moved and renamed. Finally, `integration/api/v1/test_text_processing_endpoints.py` needs refactoring to stop mocking the internal `TextProcessorService` and instead follow the superior pattern seen in `integration/test_request_isolation.py`.

## Guiding Principles Analysis

My recommendations are based on the key distinctions between test categories as defined in your documentation:

* **Integration vs. E2E Tests**: This is the most critical boundary for this review. An **integration test** verifies internal components working together, using high-fidelity fakes or containers for immediate infrastructure, but it **mocks true third-party services** (like the Gemini API). An **E2E test**, conversely, makes **real network calls** to those external services using test credentials to verify the entire workflow in a production-like environment.
* **E2E vs. Manual Tests**: The defining difference is **automation**. E2E tests are automated scripts run by a framework like `pytest`. Manual tests are executed by a human, often for exploratory purposes or to validate integrations with live production services that are too complex to automate reliably.
* **Behavioral Testing**: All tests, regardless of category, should focus on observable outcomes and public contracts, avoiding assertions on internal implementation details. Mocking should only occur at system boundaries.

## Detailed Recommendations by Directory

### `backend/tests/e2e/`

* **`cache/` (entire directory)**
    * **Recommendation:** **Move**
    * **Action:** Move the entire `backend/tests/e2e/cache/` directory to `backend/tests/integration/cache/e2e/` or merge its contents into the existing `backend/tests/integration/cache/`.
    * **Rationale:** These tests are textbook examples of **high-fidelity integration tests**, not E2E tests. They use `Testcontainers` to spin up a real Redis instance and test the collaboration between the API endpoints and the cache infrastructure. This is a fantastic practice, but its boundary is drawn around your application and its immediate infrastructure. No true external, third-party network dependency (like an LLM API) is called. Your `INTEGRATION_TESTS.md` file defines this scope perfectly as an integration test's "internal world". The tests themselves are well-written and behavior-focused; they are simply miscategorized.

### `backend/tests/integration/`

* **`api/v1/test_text_processing_endpoints.py`**
    * **Recommendation:** **Refactor**
    * **Action:** Rewrite this test to follow the pattern established in `integration/test_request_isolation.py`.
    * **Rationale:** This test currently mocks the internal `TextProcessorService` by using `app.dependency_overrides`. This is a direct violation of the principle to **"Strictly no mocking of internal collaborators"**. The test verifies that the endpoint calls a mock, which is a brittle implementation test. The correct, behavioral approach is demonstrated perfectly in `integration/test_request_isolation.py`, which tests the full stack from the HTTP endpoint down, mocking only the true external boundaryâ€”the `Agent` class that makes the call to the Gemini API. This refactor will significantly increase the test's value and resilience.

* **All other `integration/` tests**
    * **Recommendation:** **Keep**
    * **Action:** No changes are needed for most other files in this directory, such as `test_request_isolation.py`, `api/v1/test_auth_endpoints.py`, and the various `api/internal/` tests.
    * **Rationale:** These tests correctly follow your integration testing philosophy. They test the collaboration of internal components from the "outside-in" (usually via `TestClient`), use mocks appropriately for external boundaries (like in `test_request_isolation.py`), and focus on observable behavior. They serve as excellent models for how integration tests should be written.

### `backend/tests/manual/`

* **`test_manual_api.py`**
    * **Recommendation:** **Move and Rename**
    * **Action:** Move `backend/tests/manual/test_manual_api.py` to `backend/tests/e2e/test_text_processing_e2e.py`.
    * **Rationale:** This test is miscategorized as "manual." Your documentation defines the distinction between E2E and Manual tests as **automation**. This is an automated `pytest` script that makes real network calls to the Gemini API (evidenced by the `pytest.mark.skipif(not os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY"), ...)` check). This perfectly matches the definition of an **E2E test**: an automated script that verifies a complete user workflow, including real external services. The "manual" part of this test is only the initial setup (running the server), not the execution. It should be reclassified as the primary E2E test for your core application feature.

### `backend/tests/performance/`

* **`test_health_check_performance.py`**
    * **Recommendation:** **Keep**
    * **Action:** No changes are needed.
    * **Rationale:** This test is correctly categorized. It does not test functional correctness but instead measures performance characteristics like timeouts, aggregation latency, and memory stability (`tracemalloc`). This aligns perfectly with the purpose of a performance test.

## Conclusion

Your test suite is in a strong position, and the existing tests in these categories are valuable. The recommended actions are primarily about re-aligning the structure with your well-defined testing philosophy. By moving the cache E2E tests to integration, promoting the manual API test to its rightful place as an E2E test, and refactoring the one problematic integration test, you will have a clean, logical, and highly effective test suite that provides maximum confidence and is easy to maintain.
