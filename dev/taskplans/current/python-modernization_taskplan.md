# Python Modernization Task Plan

## Context and Rationale

The FastAPI-Streamlit-LLM-Starter project requires modernization to Python 3.13 as the default development target while maintaining compatibility with Python 3.12-3.13. The current configuration shows inconsistency across components: Docker containers use Python 3.11, CI/CD tests Python 3.9-3.11, and the shared library allows Python 3.8+. This modernization addresses Python 3.9's end-of-life (October 2025), leverages performance improvements of 10-60% in Python 3.11+ plus additional 15-20% gains in Python 3.13, and positions the project for cutting-edge Python features including experimental free-threading and enhanced performance optimizations.

### Identified Configuration Gaps
- **CI/CD Testing Matrix**: Currently tests outdated Python versions [`"3.9", "3.10", "3.11"`] instead of modern versions [`"3.12", "3.13"`].
- **Shared Library Requirements**: `shared/pyproject.toml` requires `">=3.8"` which includes EOL versions, should be `">=3.12"`.
- **Project Configuration**: No root-level `pyproject.toml` exists for unified project management.
- **Development Environment**: Missing `.python-version` file for consistent Python 3.13 development setup.
- **Documentation**: References to outdated Python versions throughout project documentation.
- **Container Images**: Using Python 3.11-slim instead of Python 3.13-slim for optimal performance.
- **Development Tooling**: Makefile and scripts may need adaptation for Python 3.12 compatibility.
- **Performance Opportunities**: Existing infrastructure services could benefit from Python 3.13 optimizations including experimental free-threading capabilities.

### Improvement Goals
- **Version Consistency**: Align all configuration files to use Python 3.12+ minimum, 3.13 default.
- **Performance Optimization**: Leverage Python 3.13 performance improvements and experimental features across infrastructure services.
- **Future Compatibility**: Establish testing matrix for Python 3.12 and 3.13 support with cutting-edge feature adoption.
- **Developer Experience**: Modernize development environment with consistent Python 3.13 version management.

### Desired Outcome
A fully modernized Python environment with Python 3.13 as the development default, comprehensive compatibility testing across 3.12-3.13, and optimized performance leveraging cutting-edge Python features including experimental free-threading for existing infrastructure services while maintaining architectural integrity.
