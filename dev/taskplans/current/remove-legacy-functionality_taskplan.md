# Legacy Functionality Removal Task Plan

## Context and Rationale

The FastAPI-Streamlit-LLM-Starter project contains extensive legacy infrastructure from configuration migration systems, backward compatibility layers, and deprecated environment variable patterns. This legacy code was initially designed to facilitate the transition from configuration approaches, particularly in resilience and cache subsystems. With the upcoming v1.0 release, this technical debt must be eliminated to reduce code complexity, improve maintainability, and establish a clean preset-based configuration system.

### Identified Legacy Components
- **Migration Infrastructure**: Complete migration utilities in `backend/app/infrastructure/resilience/migration_utils.py` handling 30+ legacy environment variables.
- **Cache Migration System**: Phase 3 to Phase 4 migration scripts managing transition from 28+ cache variables to preset system.
- **Old Scripts Directory**: Seven deprecated scripts in `backend/scripts/old/` serving no current purpose.
- **Backward Compatibility Tests**: 760+ lines of compatibility tests ensuring deprecated patterns still function.
- **Legacy Environment Variables**: Direct usage of deprecated variables throughout the codebase instead of preset-based configuration.
- **Phase References**: Documentation and code containing implementation-specific "Phase 3/4" terminology.

### Improvement Goals
- **Clean Architecture**: Remove all migration utilities and backward compatibility layers.
- **Simplified Configuration**: Standardize exclusively on preset-based configuration system.
- **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminate 2000+ lines of legacy code and test infrastructure.
- **Clear Documentation**: Remove migration guides and phase-specific references.
- **Maintainability**: Establish clear configuration patterns without legacy baggage.

### Desired Outcome
A streamlined codebase with zero legacy migration infrastructure, unified preset-based configuration, simplified testing infrastructure focused on current functionality, and clear documentation without historical implementation details. The project will be ready for v1.0 release with significantly reduced technical debt and improved maintainability.
