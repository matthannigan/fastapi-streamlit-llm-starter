# Secure-First Redis Implementation Task Plan

## Context and Rationale

The FastAPI-Streamlit-LLM Starter project will implement a **security-first Redis architecture** where secure connections and data encryption are mandatory, not optional. This represents a fundamental shift from configurable security to **foundational security** that eliminates configuration complexity and prevents accidental insecure deployments.

The implementation follows the PRD at `dev/taskplans/current/redis-critical-security-gaps_PRD.md` which establishes our **"pit of success"** philosophy: security is not configurable - it's always enabled.

### Core Security Requirements
- **Mandatory TLS**: All Redis connections must use TLS encryption and authentication in all environments
- **Always-On Encryption**: All cached data encrypted at rest using Fernet encryption
- **Fail-Fast Design**: Application fails immediately on startup if security requirements aren't met
- **Environment-Aware Defaults**: Security configuration automatically adapts to environment while maintaining security
- **Zero-Configuration Security**: Developers get secure Redis with a single setup command

### Breaking Change Notice
This implementation **eliminates backward compatibility** with existing insecure configurations. All Redis connections must be secure, and all cached data must be encrypted. This is an intentional breaking change to enforce security-first design.

### Testing Strategy Note
**IMPORTANT**: This implementation will cause breaking changes for many cache tests that use Fakeredis or Testcontainers. Testing will be handled through a separate PRD and is explicitly excluded from this implementation taskplan.
