I want to add a new text processor service that will leverage the recently implemented batch functionality. See: https://github.com/matthannigan/fastapi-streamlit-llm-starter/pull/2

I’m thinking of a pros/cons processor that takes an idea and lists the arguments in favor and those against. The method under the hood would be to make 3 LLM calls with 3 different prompts:
- you are in favor of the user’s idea, state 3-5 reasons why
- you are opposed to the user’s idea, state 3-5 reasons why
- you are an expert text synthesizer that brings together multiple perspectives to provide a balanced pros/cons list about the user’s idea (prompt includes original idea and outputs of prior two prompts)

Don’t write any code yet. In general, let’s discuss this idea!

And specifically:
- Does this seem like a good use of the batch process functionality?
- What are 5 silly and 5 semi-serious ideas we could use as sample text (e.g., pineapple on pizza, API-first web development)?

This is a fantastic idea! Let me break down why this pros/cons processor is such a clever addition and address your specific questions.

## Why This Is a Great Use of Batch Processing

**Perfect Fit for Batch Functionality:**
- **Natural Parallelization**: The three LLM calls (pro, con, synthesis) can run in parallel for the first two, then the synthesis call depends on their results
- **Demonstrates Real Value**: This shows how batch processing enables more sophisticated AI workflows that would be too slow sequentially
- **Cost-Effective**: Instead of making expensive sequential calls, you're maximizing throughput
- **User Experience**: Users get a comprehensive analysis that feels "smart" rather than just a single AI response

**Technical Benefits:**
- **Showcases Batch Patterns**: Pro/con calls are independent (perfect for parallel batch), synthesis call shows how to handle dependencies
- **Error Resilience**: If one perspective fails, you could still provide partial results
- **Caching Opportunities**: The three distinct prompts create different cache keys, so repeated similar ideas get faster responses

## Sample Ideas for Testing

**5 Silly Ideas:**
1. "Wearing socks with sandals should be socially acceptable"
2. "Pineapple belongs on pizza" (classic!)
3. "We should replace all meetings with interpretive dance"
4. "Cats should be required to wear tiny business suits"
5. "Breakfast cereal is the perfect dinner food"

**5 Semi-Serious Ideas:**
1. "Remote work should be the default for all knowledge workers"
2. "API-first development is better than UI-first development"
3. "Every city should ban cars from downtown areas"
4. "Universal Basic Income should replace traditional welfare"
5. "All software should be open source by default"

## Strategic Implementation Thoughts

**This Addition Would:**
- **Demonstrate Sophisticated AI Workflows**: Shows the template can handle complex, multi-step AI processes
- **Highlight Batch Processing Value**: Users can see immediate benefit vs. sequential processing
- **Create a Compelling Demo**: Pros/cons analysis is intuitive and impressive to showcase
- **Add Business Value**: This type of analysis is genuinely useful for decision-making

**Technical Architecture Considerations:**
- **Dependency Handling**: You'll need to handle the synthesis step that depends on the first two results
- **Partial Results**: Consider how to handle cases where only 1-2 of the 3 calls succeed
- **Result Formatting**: The final output structure will be richer than other operations
- **Prompt Engineering**: Each of the three prompts needs to be carefully crafted for distinct perspectives

**Would this fit into the existing `ProcessingOperation` enum as `PROS_CONS`?** Or are you thinking of this as a separate endpoint that specifically showcases batch processing?

This feels like it could be the "killer feature" that makes people excited about the template - it's sophisticated enough to be impressive but simple enough to understand immediately.
