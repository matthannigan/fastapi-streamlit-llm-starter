## 1. Prompt Injection Vulnerability (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

### Current State & Gaps

**Vulnerability Location**: `backend/app/services/text_processor.py`

**Current Implementation**:
The current implementation directly embeds user input into AI prompts using simple string formatting without any sanitization or validation.

**Critical Gaps**:
- **Direct String Interpolation**: User input is directly embedded into AI prompts without any sanitization
- **No Input Validation**: No checks for malicious prompt injection patterns
- **Missing Output Filtering**: AI responses are returned without validation
- **Lack of Context Isolation**: No separation between system instructions and user content

### Security Implications

**High Severity Risks**:
- **Prompt Hijacking**: Attackers can inject instructions to override system behavior
- **Data Exfiltration**: Malicious prompts could extract cached data or system information
- **AI Manipulation**: Users can force the AI to produce harmful, biased, or inappropriate content
- **System Prompt Leakage**: Attackers might extract internal system prompts and instructions
- **Cross-User Contamination**: Injection could affect subsequent requests through context pollution

**Attack Examples**:
- Inputs attempting to ignore previous instructions and reveal system information
- Inputs trying to override the AI's role and extract sensitive data
- Malicious prompts designed to contaminate future responses

### Improvement Opportunities

#### 1. Input Sanitization Framework
Implement a comprehensive input sanitization system that identifies and removes potential injection patterns, escapes special characters, and enforces input length limits.

#### 2. Structured Prompt Templates
Create secure prompt templates that clearly separate system instructions from user content using structured formatting with proper escaping and role-based sections.

#### 3. Output Validation
Implement response validation to check for leaked system information, validate response formats, and filter inappropriate content before returning results.

#### 4. Context Isolation
- Implement separate AI contexts for different users
- Clear context between requests
- Use role-based prompt structuring

## 2. Redis Security Vulnerabilities (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Current State & Gaps

**Vulnerability Location**: `backend/app/services/cache.py` and `backend/app/config.py`

**Current Implementation**:
The Redis connection uses basic configuration without authentication, encryption, or access controls.

**Critical Gaps**:
- **No Authentication**: Redis connection has no AUTH password
- **No Encryption**: Data transmitted in plaintext
- **No Access Control**: No user-based permissions
- **Weak Connection String**: Default Redis URL without security parameters
- **Missing Security Headers**: No SSL/TLS configuration

### Security Implications

**High Severity Risks**:
- **Unauthorized Data Access**: Anyone with network access can read cached data
- **Cache Poisoning**: Attackers can inject malicious cached responses
- **Data Interception**: Network traffic can be monitored and modified
- **Lateral Movement**: Compromised Redis can be used to attack other services
- **Data Persistence**: Sensitive user data stored without encryption

### Improvement Opportunities

#### 1. Redis Authentication & Authorization
Implement proper authentication with username/password credentials, ensuring Redis password is required and properly configured in environment variables.

#### 2. TLS/SSL Implementation
Configure SSL/TLS encryption for Redis connections including client certificates, certificate authority validation, and hostname verification.

#### 3. Data Encryption at Rest
Implement encryption for cached data using symmetric encryption (e.g., Fernet) with proper key management and encrypted storage/retrieval methods.

#### 4. Access Control Lists (ACLs)
Configure Redis ACLs to create specific users with limited permissions for different operations, restricting access to specific key patterns and commands.

#### 5. Network Security
Implement network-level security including isolated networks, TLS configuration, and proper Docker network security.

## 3. Access Control & Authorization Gaps (HIGH PRIORITY)

### Current State & Gaps

**Vulnerability Location**: `backend/app/main.py` and various endpoints

**Current Implementation**:
The current system lacks proper authorization controls, allowing any valid API key to access any resource without ownership validation.

**Critical Gaps**:
- **Missing Object-Level Authorization**: No ownership validation for batch operations
- **Insecure Direct Object References**: Batch IDs can be accessed by any authenticated user
- **Optional Authentication on Sensitive Endpoints**: Internal metrics exposed without proper auth
- **No Role-Based Access Control**: All API keys have identical permissions
- **Missing Audit Logging**: No tracking of who accessed what resources

### Security Implications

**Medium-High Severity Risks**:
- **Data Leakage**: Users can access other users' batch results
- **Information Disclosure**: Internal application metrics exposed
- **Reconnaissance**: Attackers can gather system information
- **Compliance Violations**: Unauthorized data access may violate regulations
- **Privilege Escalation**: Lack of role separation increases attack surface

### Improvement Opportunities

#### 1. Resource Ownership Model
Implement a resource ownership tracking system that associates resources with API keys and validates ownership before allowing access to resources.

#### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Create a comprehensive RBAC system with different roles (USER, ADMIN, METRICS_READER, BATCH_PROCESSOR) and role-based permission checking.

#### 3. Enhanced Authentication Context
Develop rich authentication context including user IDs, roles, permissions, and rate limits for comprehensive access control.

#### 4. Audit Logging Framework
Implement comprehensive audit logging for all access attempts including user identification, resource access, actions performed, and results.

## 4. Insufficient Authentication Controls (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### Current State & Gaps

**Vulnerability Location**: `backend/app/auth.py` and various endpoints

**Current Implementation**:
The authentication system has several weaknesses including development mode bypasses and optional authentication on sensitive endpoints.

**Critical Gaps**:
- **Development Mode Bypass**: Complete authentication bypass when no keys configured
- **Optional Authentication Abuse**: Sensitive endpoints exposed without proper protection
- **No API Key Lifecycle Management**: No expiration, rotation, or revocation
- **Weak API Key Storage**: Keys stored in environment variables without encryption
- **No Multi-Factor Authentication**: Single-factor authentication only

### Security Implications

**Medium Severity Risks**:
- **Accidental Production Exposure**: Development mode could reach production
- **Information Leakage**: Metrics and status exposed to unauthenticated users
- **Long-Term Key Compromise**: No key rotation increases exposure window
- **Credential Stuffing**: No protection against automated attacks
- **Session Management**: No session timeout or invalidation

### Improvement Opportunities

#### 1. Secure Authentication Mode Enforcement
Implement strict authentication enforcement that prevents development mode bypasses in production environments and ensures proper authentication configuration.

#### 2. API Key Lifecycle Management
Create comprehensive API key management including key creation with expiration dates, usage tracking, validation with expiration checks, and proper metadata storage.

#### 3. Enhanced Security Headers
Implement comprehensive security headers including content type protection, frame options, XSS protection, transport security, content security policy, and referrer policy.

#### 4. Multi-Factor Authentication Support
Add support for multi-factor authentication including TOTP validation and user-specific MFA requirements.

## 5. Application-Level Rate Limiting Gaps (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### Current State & Gaps

**Vulnerability Location**: Currently only nginx-level rate limiting exists

**Current Implementation**:
Only basic nginx rate limiting is implemented with no application-level controls or user-specific limitations.

**Critical Gaps**:
- **No Application-Level Rate Limiting**: Only nginx provides basic protection
- **No User-Specific Limits**: All users share the same rate limits
- **No Resource-Based Limiting**: Expensive operations not specially limited
- **Missing Burst Protection**: No protection against coordinated attacks
- **No Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Limits don't adjust based on system load

### Security Implications

**Medium Severity Risks**:
- **Resource Exhaustion**: AI operations can be expensive and slow
- **DoS Attacks**: Valid API keys can overwhelm the system
- **Cost Amplification**: Expensive AI calls can increase operational costs
- **Service Degradation**: Heavy users can impact performance for others
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Unlimited access could enable data harvesting

### Improvement Opportunities

#### 1. Multi-Tier Rate Limiting
Implement different rate limiting tiers (FREE, PREMIUM, ENTERPRISE) with varying limits for requests per minute/hour, AI calls, and batch sizes based on user subscription levels.

#### 2. Resource-Based Rate Limiting
Create operation-specific rate limiting that considers the computational cost of different operations and adjusts limits based on text length and batch sizes.

#### 3. Adaptive Rate Limiting
Implement dynamic rate limiting that adjusts based on system load, reducing limits when the system is under stress and gradually restoring them as load decreases.

#### 4. Circuit Breaker Integration
Add circuit breaker functionality for users who frequently violate rate limits, temporarily blocking users who exceed thresholds too often.
