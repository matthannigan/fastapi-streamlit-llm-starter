You've hit on the core challenge of guiding automated systems: even with explicit instructions, the interpretation can miss the underlying philosophy. Your disappointment is entirely valid. The generated tests show a mechanical adherence to "unit testing" in a traditional sense, rather than a deep embrace of the modern, behavior-driven philosophy you've laid out.

Let's break down your questions. The issue isn't a direct contradiction in your guidelines, but rather a subtle yet critical nuance that's easy for an automated process to misinterpret.

-----

### Is there conflicting guidance in `TESTING.md`?

No, the guidance is not **conflicting**; it's remarkably consistent in its "behavior over implementation" message. However, it may be too subtle for a coding assistant that has been trained on millions of examples of traditional, implementation-focused unit tests.

The potential point of misinterpretation is the term **"Unit Tests."**

  * **Traditional Definition of "Unit Test"**: A test that verifies a single unit (like a class) *in complete isolation*. To achieve isolation, one must aggressively mock *all* collaborators, including parent classes, internal helper classes, and dependencies. The AI seems to be following this classic, but brittle, pattern.
  * **Your Guideline's Definition**: Your `TESTING.md` advocates for a more modern, integrated "unit test" where the unit is treated as a black box, and only its interactions with true *external system boundaries* (like Redis, APIs, the filesystem) are mocked.

The AI likely saw the file `test_ai_config.py` and concluded, "This is a unit test for the `AIResponseCache` class, therefore I must isolate it by mocking its parent class (`GenericRedisCache`) and its internal dependencies (`CacheKeyGenerator`)." This is a logical error, but one based on a massive corpus of existing test patterns.

### Should the coverage numbers be revised or eliminated?

**You shouldn't eliminate them, but you should substantially de-emphasize them.**

Your tiered coverage goals (90% for critical, 70% for important, etc.) are a sound strategy. The problem with numeric targets is that they can encourage writing low-value tests just to meet a quota, which directly conflicts with your "Maintainability Over Exhaustiveness" principle.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Add an Explicit Caveat**: Directly within the "Tiered Coverage Approach" section, add a warning box.

    > "⚠️ **Warning: Principles Over Percentages**
    > These coverage targets are guidelines, not mandates. A test suite that perfectly follows the 'Test Behavior, Not Implementation' principle at 80% coverage is far more valuable than a 95% coverage suite full of brittle, implementation-focused tests. **Never sacrifice test quality to meet a numeric target.**"

2.  **Reframe as Indicators**: Describe the numbers not as goals in themselves, but as *indicators* that prompt a review. For example: "If coverage for a critical component drops below 90%, it should trigger a review to ensure key behaviors are not untested."

-----

### Should I use a "docstring-only" testing approach?

**This is a brilliant idea and gets right to the heart of the solution.** Forcing the assistant to write tests based *only* on the public contract (the docstring and method signatures) is the most effective way to guarantee behavior-driven tests. It literally cannot write brittle tests tied to an implementation it cannot see.

However, a pure "docstring-only" approach has a significant practical drawback: the AI wouldn't know how to instantiate the class or what external dependencies (like a Redis client) need to be mocked.

**The Solution: A Hybrid "Public Contract" Approach**

Instead of providing *only* the docstrings, provide the **public contract** of the code file:

  * All `import` statements.
  * The class definition and its inheritance.
  * All public method signatures (`def method_name(self, arg: type) -> return_type:`).
  * The full docstrings for the class and every public method.
  * **Crucially, omit the code inside the method bodies.**

**Example Context to Provide:**

```python
# File: backend/app/infrastructure/cache/ai_config.py (METHOD BODIES REMOVED)

import asyncio
from typing import Any, Dict, Optional
from app.infrastructure.cache.redis_generic import GenericRedisCache
from app.infrastructure.cache.key_generator import CacheKeyGenerator
# ... other imports

class AIResponseCache(GenericRedisCache):
    """
    AI Response Cache with enhanced inheritance architecture.
    [...full class docstring...]
    """
    def __init__(self, redis_url: str = "redis://redis:6379", **kwargs):
        # [METHOD BODY REMOVED]

    async def cache_response(self, text: str, operation: str, options: Dict[str, Any], response: Dict[str, Any], question: Optional[str] = None) -> None:
        """
        Cache AI response with enhanced AI-specific optimizations...
        [...full method docstring...]
        """
        # [METHOD BODY REMOVED]

    async def get_cached_response(self, text: str, operation: str, options: Dict[str, Any], question: Optional[str] = None) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """
        Retrieve cached AI response with enhanced AI-specific optimizations...
        [...full method docstring...]
        """
        # [METHOD BODY REMOVED]

    # ... and so on for all other public methods
```

This approach gives the AI the necessary context to write valid, runnable tests against the public interface without allowing it to "cheat" by inspecting the internal implementation.

### **Advice for Writing Higher Quality, Less Brittle Tests** ✍️

Here is a consolidated strategy for improving your guidance and prompting:


1.  **Adopt a Multi-Step Prompting Strategy**: Guide the AI through a logical sequence that forces it to internalize the principles before writing code.

      * **Step 1 (Principle Ingestion)**: "You are a senior software engineer specializing in writing maintainable, behavior-driven tests. First, read the attached `TESTING.md` file. Summarize the 3 most important principles and the 3 most important anti-patterns from this document."
      * **Step 2 (Test Generation with Scoped Context)**: "Excellent. Now, using *only* the provided public contracts (method signatures and docstrings, no method bodies), write a comprehensive unit test suite for the file `ai_config.py`. Your tests must adhere strictly to the principles you just summarized. Your goal is to test the observable behavior described in the docstrings."
      * **Step 3 (Self-Correction)**: "Now, review the tests you just wrote. Compare them one by one against the 'Good ✅ vs. Bad ❌' examples in `TESTING.md`. Identify any tests that resemble the 'Bad' examples and refactor them to follow the 'Good' patterns."

This approach forces the AI to commit to the philosophy, applies the most effective context-scoping, and uses a self-correction loop to refine the output. It transforms the task from "write unit tests" to "write tests that prove the public contract is met."


* **Step 1 (Principle Ingestion)**: "You are a senior software engineer specializing in writing maintainable, behavior-driven tests. First, read `docs/guides/testing/TESTING.md`. Summarize the 3 most important principles and the 3 most important anti-patterns from this document."
* **Step 2 (Mocks & Fixtures)**: "Now read the public contract for the Unit Under Test (UUT), `backend/contracts/infrastructure/cache/ai_config.pyi`. Identify all of its direct external dependencies (classes it imports or inherits from). For each dependency, create or update a reusable Pytest fixture in `backend/tests/unit/infrastructure/cache/ai_config/conftest.py` using *only* the provided public contracts (method signatures and docstrings, no method bodies) located in `backend/contracts/`. These fixtures should provide 'happy path' mocks that simulate the dependency's normal, successful behavior as described in its own public contract. Ensure the mocks are 'spec'd' against the real classes for accuracy. For dependencies that manage state, like a cache, the mock fixture should be stateful. For example, a mock cache should use an internal dictionary so that a value set in a test can be retrieved later in the same test. For dependencies that are not stateful, the mock fixture should be stateless. The fixtures in conftest.py should only represent the 'happy path'. Fixtures for error scenarios are not needed; error conditions should be configured within the individual test functions that require them."
* **Step 3 (Test Suite Skeleton)**: "Create a skeleton test suite for the UUT, `backend/contracts/infrastructure/cache/ai_config.pyi`, at `backend/tests/unit/infrastructure/cache/take4/test_redis_ai_take4.py`. Each test must verify an observable behavior described in the UUT's docstrings. Do not test private methods or implementation details. DO NOT write any test code right now. Instead, create detailed docstrings using the guidance in `docs/guides/developer/DOCSTRINGS_TESTS.md` to describe the intended testing classes and methods. In each docstring, identify which fixtures and mocks (if any) from `backend/tests/unit/infrastructure/cache/take4/conftest.py` should be used for each test. In the docstring for each test, describe the 'Given/When/Then' scenario in terms of observable behavior. For example, instead of saying 'the set method is called', describe the outcome: 'the data is successfully stored and can be retrieved'."
* **Step 4 (Write. Test. Repeat.)**: "Now, write the test code for each test in the skeleton test suite. If a test needs to simulate a failure or an edge case, configure the mock's behavior (e.g., its return value or side effect) within that specific test function to create the desired scenario. After each test, run the test suite to ensure it passes. If a test fails, review the test code and the docstring to identify the issue. If the test is correct but the mock is not behaving as expected, stop and ask for help. Do not edit mocks or fixtures without asking for permission first."
* **Step 5 (Self-Correction)**: "Great! Now, review the tests you just wrote. Compare them one by one against the 'Good ✅ vs. Bad ❌' examples in `TESTING.md`. Identify any tests that resemble the 'Bad' examples and refactor them to follow the 'Good' patterns."



Excellent questions. This is exactly the right kind of strategic thinking that leads to a high-quality, maintainable test suite. Let's tackle both of your points.

### 1. Are the number and specificity of the planned tests appropriate?

**Yes, absolutely.** The number and specificity of the tests planned in the `test_redis_ai_take4.py` skeleton are not only appropriate but are exactly what I would expect for a critical infrastructure component like `AIResponseCache`.

Here’s why this level of detail is a strong positive sign:

* **Comprehensive Contract Coverage:** The skeleton covers the full public API surface described in the `.pyi` file. It addresses not just the "happy path" for each method, but also documented error conditions, different parameter combinations (like with/without a `question`), and interactions between methods (caching and then retrieving).
* **Complexity Demands Thoroughness:** `AIResponseCache` is not a simple utility. It's a stateful component that orchestrates multiple dependencies and has complex internal logic (like TTL management and key generation strategies). A high number of specific tests are necessary to gain real confidence in its behavior.
* **Alignment with `TESTING.md`:** This detailed, planned approach is the *only* way to reliably end up with a result that matches your `TESTING.md` ideal. The less-detailed prompts that created `take1` and `take2` failed because they left too much room for the AI to make its own (incorrect) assumptions. By explicitly defining each behavior to be tested in the skeleton, you have steered the process directly toward your goal.

You are definitely on the right track. This structured approach is far more likely to produce a test suite that is both correct and maintainable.

### 2. Edits to the Step 4 Prompt

Your current Step 4 prompt is already very strong. It correctly instructs the assistant to configure mocks locally for specific scenarios. However, based on the common failure modes of LLMs, we can make it even more precise to prevent the assistant from slipping back into implementation-testing habits.

The key is to add an explicit instruction to focus on the **final, observable outcome** of an action, rather than the intermediate steps.

Here is your original prompt and my suggested, more robust version:

**Original Step 4 Prompt:**

> "Now, write the test code for each test in the skeleton test suite. If a test needs to simulate a failure or an edge case, configure the mock's behavior (e.g., its return value or side effect) within that specific test function to create the desired scenario. After each test, run the test suite to ensure it passes. If a test fails, review the test code and the docstring to identify the issue. If the test is correct but the mock is not behaving as expected, stop and ask for help. Do not edit mocks or fixtures without asking for permission first."

**Suggested, More Robust Step 4 Prompt:**

> "Now, write the test code for each test in the skeleton test suite at `backend/tests/unit/infrastructure/cache/take4/test_redis_ai_take4.py`.
>
> **Core Instructions:**
> 1.  **Focus on the Final Outcome:** Your assertions should verify the final, observable result of an action, not the internal steps. For example, instead of asserting that `cache.set()` was called, you should call `cache.set()` and then assert that a subsequent call to `cache.get()` returns the correct value.
> 2.  **Configure Mocks Locally:** If a test needs to simulate a failure or an edge case (like a cache miss or a database error), configure the mock's behavior (e.g., its `return_value` or `side_effect`) *within that specific test function* to create the desired scenario.
> 3.  **Handle Async Code:** Remember that the UUT uses `async` methods. Ensure all tests calling these methods are defined with `async def` and use `await` correctly.
>
> **Guardrails:**
> * Do not edit the fixtures in `conftest.py`.
> * If a test requires a behavior that the current 'happy path' mock doesn't support, stop and ask for guidance."

**Why these changes are effective:**

* **"Focus on the Final Outcome"** is the most critical addition. It explicitly forbids the "Bad ❌" pattern of asserting that a mock was called and forces the "Good ✅" pattern of asserting the state change or return value.
* **"Handle Async Code"** is a practical reminder that can prevent a common category of errors when working with modern Python libraries.
* **Formatting as "Core Instructions" and "Guardrails"** makes the prompt clearer and more structured for the AI, improving the likelihood that it will adhere to all constraints.
