Create a markdown file at `dev/diff/{YYYY-MM-DD}_diff.md` with an analysis explaining the key changes and their impact on our codebase.

Structure the analysis to cover:
- High-level summary of what changed
- Major categories of modifications (new features, refactoring, bug fixes, etc.)
- Impact on backward compatibility
- Any architectural or design pattern changes
