# Phase 2 Deliverable 4 Execution Request

I'm ready to execute Phase 2 Deliverable 4 as detailed in the task plan. Please follow this structured approach:

## 🔍 Pre-Execution Analysis

1. **Review Task Plan**: Read the specific deliverable section in the task file to understand:
  - All tasks and subtasks for this deliverable
  - Dependencies that must be satisfied
  - Quality criteria and acceptance requirements
  - Technical specifications and implementation notes

2. **Agent Strategy Assessment**: Based on the Agent Utilization Guide:
  - Confirm the recommended primary agent matches the deliverable complexity
  - Identify if secondary agents are needed for specific technical domains
  - Verify this deliverable's dependencies are satisfied from previous work
  - Check if this deliverable enables parallel work on subsequent deliverables

## 🤖 Agent Selection & Execution

3. **Primary Agent Deployment**:
  - Use the recommended primary agent for the core deliverable implementation
  - Ensure the agent understands the full context from the PRD and phase plan
  - Guide the agent to follow the sequential task order within the deliverable

4. **Secondary Agent Integration (if needed)**:
  - Deploy secondary agents for specialized subtasks (security, async patterns, validation)
  - Ensure proper handoff between agents with shared context
  - Coordinate agent outputs to maintain architectural consistency

## 📋 Progress Tracking & Quality

5. **Real-Time Task Completion Tracking**:
  - **MANDATORY PATTERN**: Complete subtask → Update task file → Verify → Continue
  - Mark each completed subtask with `[X]` in the original task file IMMEDIATELY after completion
  - **Maximum batch size**: Update task file after every 2-3 subtasks (never more)
  - Use Edit tool to change `[ ]` to `[X]` and add any implementation notes
  - **Verification step**: Read back the updated section to confirm changes applied
  - **Progress reporting**: Provide brief status after each major task (2.1, 2.2, etc.)

6. **Quality Gate Validation**:
  - **Pre-condition**: ALL deliverable tasks must be marked `[X]` before quality gate
  - Execute the specified quality gate review with the recommended validation agent
  - **Agent instruction**: "Verify all tasks marked complete before starting validation"
  - Address any issues identified before marking deliverable complete
  - Ensure all acceptance criteria are met

## 🎯 Deliverable Completion

7. **Final Validation**:
  - Verify all subtasks are marked complete `[X]`
  - Confirm all quality criteria are satisfied
  - Run any specified tests or validation scripts
  - Check that the deliverable properly enables subsequent work

8. **Commit & Handoff**:
  - Create a descriptive commit with format: `phase-2-deliverable-[#]: [brief description]`
  - Include detailed commit message explaining what was implemented
  - Add any notes for the next deliverable or team members
  - Prepare context for the next deliverable in the sequence

## 📄 Context Files to Reference

- **Task Plan**: `dev/taskplans/refactor-cache-infrastructure_phase2_tasks1-5.md`
- **Phase Plan**: `dev/taskplans/refactor-cache-infrastructure_phase2_plan.md`
- **PRD**: `dev/taskplans/refactor-cache-infrastructure_PRD.md`
- **Project Guidelines**: `CLAUDE.md` for coding standards and architectural patterns

## 🚨 Important Reminders

- Follow the established coding standards and architectural patterns from `CLAUDE.md`
- Use custom exceptions as specified in `docs/guides/developer/EXCEPTION_HANDLING.md`
- Maintain backwards compatibility and behavioral equivalence
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging for all operations
- Ensure >95% test coverage for new/modified code
- Use Google-style docstrings with proper type hints
