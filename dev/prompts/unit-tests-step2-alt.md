Now we're continuing the process of creating unit tests for modules in `backend/app/infrastructure/cache/benchmarks/` only using their explicit public contracts in `backend/contracts/infrastructure/cache/benchmarks/`.

The modules currently being reviewed are:
- `config.py`
- `core.py`
- `generator.py`
- `models.py`
- `reporting.py`
- `utils.py`

For each public contract:
1. Thoroughly review the public contract of the Unit Under Test (UUT) at `backend/contracts/infrastructure/cache/benchmarks/[module].pyi`.
2. Then review mocks and fixtures shared by all cache unit tests in `backend/tests/unit/infrastructure/cache/conftest.py`.
3. Identify all of the UUT's direct external dependencies (classes it imports or inherits from). For each new dependency not already represented in `backend/tests/unit/infrastructure/cache/conftest.py`, create or update a reusable Pytest fixture in `backend/tests/unit/infrastructure/cache/benchmarks/conftest.py` using *only* the provided public contracts (method signatures and docstrings, no method bodies) located in `backend/contracts/`. 
   - Ensure the mocks are 'spec'd' against the real classes for accuracy.
   - These fixtures should provide 'happy path' mocks that simulate the dependency's normal, successful behavior as described in its own public contract. Fixtures for error scenarios are not needed; error conditions should be configured within the individual test functions that require them.
   - For dependencies that manage state, like a cache, the mock fixture should be stateful. For example, a mock cache should use an internal dictionary so that a value set in a test can be retrieved later in the same test. For dependencies that are not stateful, the mock fixture should be stateless.
4. Do not create any `conftest.py` files in subdirectories beneath `backend/tests/unit/infrastructure/cache/benchmarks/`.
