We are deactivating internal cache test mocks in favor of real fakes or integration tests in `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/**/conftest.py`.

We have identified the following mocks that are being phased out:

* **Mocks of Internal `cache` Classes:**
    * `mock_generic_redis_cache` (from `conftest.py`)
    * `mock_ai_response_cache` (from `factory/conftest.py`)
    * `mock_cache_factory` (from `conftest.py`)
    * `mock_memory_cache` (from `conftest.py`)

* **Mocks of Internal `cache` Utilities/Helpers:**
    * `mock_validation_result` (from `ai_config/conftest.py`, `cache_presets/conftest.py`, `config/conftest.py`)
    * `mock_validation_result_with_errors` (from `cache_presets/conftest.py`)
    * `mock_cache_validator` (from `cache_presets/conftest.py`)
    * `mock_parameter_mapper` (from `redis_ai/conftest.py`)
    * `mock_parameter_mapper_with_validation_errors` (from `redis_ai/conftest.py`)
    * `mock_key_generator` (from `redis_ai/conftest.py`)
    * `mock_performance_monitor` (from `conftest.py`)
    * `mock_callback_registry` (from `redis_generic/conftest.py`)
    * `mock_security_config`, `mock_tls_security_config` (from `redis_generic/conftest.py`)

* **Mocks for Simulating Specific Failure Conditions:**
    * `mock_redis_connection_failure` (from `redis_ai/conftest.py`)

* **Mocks of Exception Classes:**
    * `mock_validation_error`, `mock_configuration_error`, `mock_infrastructure_error` (from `conftest.py`)

For each of these mocks, please add a custom deactivation comment to the fixture's current code. This will enable us to easily find and refactor any test using these fixtures.

Example of current code:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_generic_redis_cache():
    """
    Mock GenericRedisCache for testing inheritance and cache operations behavior.
    
    ...
    """
    from app.infrastructure.cache.redis_generic import GenericRedisCache
    from unittest.mock import patch
    ...
```

Desired state:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_generic_redis_cache():
    """
    DEACTIVATED: This mock is being phased out. Any test using this fixture needs to be refactored.

    ...original docstring...
    """
    pytest.skip("This test relies on the outdated 'mock_generic_redis_cache' fixture.")
    ...original code...
```
