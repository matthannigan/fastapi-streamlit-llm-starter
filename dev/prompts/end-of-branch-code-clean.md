Plan: Comprehensive Cache Infrastructure Code Review

Phase 1: Automated Analysis

1. Run Flake8 on entire cache module - identify all style/lint issues across all files
2. Run MyPy on entire cache module - comprehensive type checking analysis
3. Parse and categorize all issues by:
  - Error severity (critical safety vs. style)
  - File priority (core dependencies first)
  - Error types (None checks, type annotations, line length, etc.)

Phase 2: Systematic Fixes

4. Fix critical type safety issues first:
  - None/Optional attribute access without checks
  - Missing type annotations for variables
  - Union type attribute access issues
5. Fix style and formatting issues:
  - Line length violations
  - Trailing whitespace
  - Import organization
6. Fix remaining type issues:
  - Incompatible type assignments
  - Call overload mismatches
  - Missing return type annotations

Phase 3: Validation & Quality Assurance

7. Re-run full analysis to ensure no regressions
8. Run cache tests to verify functionality remains intact
9. Document any remaining acceptable issues with proper type: ignore comments

This comprehensive review will ensure the cache infrastructure is production-ready with clean code standards before branch completion.
