## üöÄ FastAPI + Streamlit LLM Starter Template

**This repository is a comprehensive starter template for building production-ready LLM-powered APIs with FastAPI.** It showcases industry best practices, robust architecture patterns, and educational examples to help developers quickly bootstrap sophisticated AI applications.

### Template Purpose & Educational Goals

This starter template demonstrates:
- **Production-ready FastAPI architecture** with dual-API design (public + internal endpoints)
- **Enterprise-grade infrastructure services** (resilience patterns, caching, monitoring, security)
- **Clean separation** between reusable infrastructure and customizable domain logic
- **Comprehensive testing strategies** with high coverage requirements
- **Modern development practices** (preset-based configuration, automated tooling, containerization)

### üì¶ Monorepo Structure

This template includes three main components designed as learning examples:

- **Backend** (`backend/`): **Production-ready FastAPI application** with robust infrastructure services and a text processing domain example
- **Frontend** (`frontend/`): **Simple Streamlit demonstration** showing how to consume the API (replace with your preferred frontend)
- **Shared** (`shared/`): **Common Pydantic models** for type safety across components

**The backend infrastructure is production-ready and reusable, while the text processing domain service and Streamlit frontend serve as educational examples meant to be replaced with your specific business logic and UI.**

### üê≥ **Docker & Containerization**
The template includes comprehensive Docker support for both development and production:
- **Development**: Hot-reload containers with file watching (`make dev`)
- **Production**: Optimized multi-stage builds (`make prod`)
- **Services**: Backend (FastAPI), Frontend (Streamlit), Redis cache
- **Docker Compose**: Full orchestration with health checks and dependency management

  - **Public API** (`/v1/`): External-facing domain endpoints with authentication
  - **Internal API** (`/internal/`): Administrative infrastructure endpoints
- **Dependency Injection** (`app/dependencies.py`): Centralized service providers with preset-based configuration
- **Core Configuration** (`app/core/`): Application setup, middleware, and settings management
- **Shared Models** (`../shared/models.py` and `app/schemas/`): Cross-service Pydantic data models

### Dual API Structure
**Public API (`/v1/`)**: External-facing endpoints
- `auth.py` - Authentication validation
- `health.py` - System health checks  
- `text_processing.py` - AI text processing operations
- `deps.py` - API-specific dependencies

**Internal API (`/internal/`)**: Administrative infrastructure endpoints
- `cache.py` - Cache management and monitoring
- `monitoring.py` - System metrics and performance
- `resilience/` - Comprehensive resilience management (circuit breakers, presets, benchmarks)

### Infrastructure Services (`app/infrastructure/`)
**Business-agnostic, reusable technical capabilities (>90% test coverage):**

- **AI Infrastructure** (`ai/`):
  - `input_sanitizer.py` - Prompt injection protection and security
  - `prompt_builder.py` - Secure prompt construction utilities

### Testing Structure
The backend uses a comprehensive testing approach that aligns with the infrastructure vs domain architecture:

**Test Organization** (`backend/tests/` directory):
- **`api/`** - API endpoint tests (dual-API structure: public + internal)
- **`core/`** - Core application functionality tests (config, middleware, exceptions)
- **`infrastructure/`** - Infrastructure service tests (cache, resilience, AI, security, monitoring)
- **`services/`** - Domain service tests (text processing, validation)
- **`integration/`** - Cross-component integration tests with mocked external services
- **`performance/`** - Performance and load testing for resilience patterns
- **Root directory** - Manual tests requiring running server and real API keys

**Test Coverage Requirements**:
- **Infrastructure services**: >90% test coverage (stable, reusable components)
- **Domain services**: >70% test coverage (customizable business logic)

**Test Execution Features**:
- **Parallel execution** by default using pytest-xdist for faster feedback cycles
- **Test markers**: `slow`, `manual`, `integration`, `retry`, `circuit_breaker`, `no_parallel`
- **Special flags**: `--run-slow` enables comprehensive resilience tests, `--run-manual` enables live API tests
- **Environment isolation**: Uses `monkeypatch.setenv()` for clean test environments
- **Coverage reporting**: HTML and terminal output with detailed metrics

### Test Configuration
Backend tests use parallel execution by default (`-n auto --dist worksteal`):
- Tests run in parallel for faster feedback cycles
- Use `monkeypatch.setenv()` for environment isolation in fixtures
- **Unit tests**: Test individual components in isolation with no external dependencies
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions with mocked external services
- **Manual tests**: Require running FastAPI server at `http://localhost:8000` and real API keys

- **Special flags**: Tests marked `slow` or `manual` are excluded by default and require explicit flags

### Manual Test Requirements
Manual tests (`-m "manual"`) require:
- FastAPI server running on `http://localhost:8000`
- `API_KEY=test-api-key-12345` environment variable for authentication tests
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable for AI features and live API testing
- Use `--run-manual` flag to enable manual tests: `pytest -v -m "manual" --run-manual`

**Setup for manual tests:**
```bash
# 1. Set environment variables
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-actual-gemini-api-key"
export API_KEY="test-api-key-12345"

# 2. Start server (from project root)

# Important Development Guidelines

- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User
