I'll mark task 9 as complete for you.

Perfect! Task 9 has been successfully marked as complete. The comprehensive test suite for security coverage has been finished. 

The system is now showing Task 10 as the next available task to work on: "Conduct Comprehensive Security Review, Update Documentation, and Perform Manual Attack Scenario Testing". This is a logical next step that builds on the test suite you just completed, focusing on:

1. **Security Review**: Peer review of all the security code we've implemented
2. **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive documentation for the security components  
3. **Manual Attack Testing**: Testing the actual PRD attack scenarios manually
4. **Security Logging Verification**: Ensuring security events are properly logged
5. **Security Review Report**: Compiling everything into a final security sign-off

This task has 5 subtasks and is marked as high priority, with task 9 as its dependency (which is now satisfied since you just completed it).

Would you like to start working on Task 10, or would you prefer to work on a different task?
