Execute Task 1

**Cursor**

I'll help you execute Task 1. First, let me check what tasks are available in your project.

Let me check the project structure to see if TaskMaster is set up and find the tasks file:

Now let me check the tasks.json file to understand what Task 1 is:

Now let me check the current state of the `backend/app/utils/sanitization.py` file to see what's already implemented:

Let me also check if there are any tests already present:

Now I understand the current state. I need to implement the `PromptSanitizer` class as specified in Task 1. The current file has basic sanitization functions, but we need to add a proper `PromptSanitizer` class with advanced forbidden patterns for prompt injection detection.

Let me start by implementing the `PromptSanitizer` class:

        efficient pattern detection.

Now let me update the test file to include comprehensive tests for the `PromptSanitizer` class initialization:

Now let's run the tests to verify that our implementation works correctly:

Let me check if pytest is installed and run the tests from the correct environment:

Excellent! All the new tests are passing. Now let's also run all the existing sanitization tests to make sure we haven't broken anything:

Perfect! All tests are passing. Let me also verify the final implementation by checking the updated sanitization file:

Now let me run one final verification test to ensure the PromptSanitizer can be imported and instantiated correctly:

Perfect! Let me update the task status to mark Task 1 as completed. First, let me check if there's a TaskMaster config:

Now let me use the terminal to mark Task 1 as completed using the TaskMaster CLI:

```

Now let's run the tests to ensure our implementation is working correctly:

I see there's an issue with the test. The word "forget" is appearing in the result, which means our pattern might not be matching as expected. Let me check what the actual result looks like and debug this:

I see the issue! The pattern `r"ignore\s+(all\s+)?previous\s+instructions"` is matching and removing "Ignore all previous instructions" correctly, but "forget" appears as a standalone word. Looking at my forbidden patterns, I have `r"forget\s+(all\s+)?previous\s+(instructions|context)"` which requires "forget" to be followed by "previous" with optional "all" in between.

The issue is that "forget everything" doesn't match the pattern `forget\s+(all\s+)?previous\s+(instructions|context)` because it's not followed by "previous". Let me check the pattern list and see if I need to add a more general "forget" pattern:

The issue is that my current pattern `r"forget\s+(all\s+)?previous\s+(instructions|context)"` is too specific. I should add a more general pattern for "forget everything" type commands. Let me update the patterns:

```python
        # Define raw regex patterns for prompt injection detection
        self.forbidden_patterns: List[str] = [
            r"ignore\s+(all\s+)?previous\s+instructions",
            r"new\s+instruction",
            r"system\s+prompt",
            r"reveal\s+.*?(password|key|secret|api_key|token)",
            r"forget\s+(all\s+)?previous\s+(instructions|context)",
            r"forget\s+(everything|all)",
            r"override\s+(previous\s+)?(instructions|settings)",
            r"act\s+as\s+(if\s+)?(you\s+are\s+)?a\s+(different|new)",
            r"you\s+are\s+now\s+a",
            r"pretend\s+(to\s+be|you\s+are)",
            r"roleplay\s+as",
            r"simulate\s+(being\s+)?a",
            r"execute\s+(this\s+)?(command|code|script)",
            r"run\s+(this\s+)?(command|code|script)",
            r"sudo\s+",
            r"admin\s+mode",
            r"developer\s+mode",
            r"debug\s+mode",
            r"maintenance\s+mode",
            r"bypass\s+(security|filter|restriction)",
            r"disable\s+(security|filter|safety)",
            r"jailbreak",
            r"escape\s+(sequence|mode)",
            r"break\s+out\s+of",
            r"exit\s+(sandbox|containment)",
            r"\\n\\n\\*",
            r"\\r\\n",
            r"\\x[0-9a-fA-F]{2}",
            r"\\u[0-9a-fA-F]{4}",
            r"base64:",
            r"eval\s*\(",
            r"exec\s*\(",
            r"import\s+(os|sys|subprocess)",
            r"from\s+(os|sys|subprocess)",
            r"__import__",
            r"\$\{.*\}",
            r"javascript:",
            r"data:text/html",
            r"<script",
            r"</script>",
            r"<iframe",
            r"onload\s*=",
            r"onerror\s*=",
            r"alert\s*\(",
            r"console\.log\s*\(",
        ]
```

Now let's test the fix:

Great! Now it's working. Let's run the tests again to see if they pass:

Now the issue is with "hacker" - the pattern `r"you\s+are\s+now\s+a"` should be matching "you are now a hacker" but it seems like the word "hacker" is remaining. Let me test this specific case:

I see! The pattern `r"you\s+are\s+now\s+a"` only matches "you are now a" but leaves "hacker" behind. I need to extend this pattern to capture the whole phrase. Let me update the pattern:

```python
        # Define raw regex patterns for prompt injection detection
        self.forbidden_patterns: List[str] = [
            r"ignore\s+(all\s+)?previous\s+instructions",
            r"new\s+instruction",
            r"system\s+prompt",
            r"reveal\s+.*?(password|key|secret|api_key|token)",
            r"forget\s+(all\s+)?previous\s+(instructions|context)",
            r"forget\s+(everything|all)",
            r"override\s+(previous\s+)?(instructions|settings)",
            r"act\s+as\s+(if\s+)?(you\s+are\s+)?a\s+(different|new)",

            r"simulate\s+(being\s+)?a",
            r"execute\s+(this\s+)?(command|code|script)",
            r"run\s+(this\s+)?(command|code|script)",
            r"sudo\s+",

            r"\\n\\n\\*",

            r"base64:",

            r"exec\s*\(",
            r"import\s+(os|sys|subprocess)",
            r"from\s+(os|sys|subprocess)",
            r"__import__",
            r"\$\{.*\}",
            r"javascript:",

            r"alert\s*\(",
            r"console\.log\s*\(",
        ]
```

Let's test this fix:

Perfect! Now let's run the comprehensive test again:

Excellent! Now let's run all the `PromptSanitizerSanitizeInput` tests to make sure everything is working:

Perfect! Now let's run all the sanitization tests to make sure I haven't broken anything:

Fantastic! All tests are passing. Let me also run a quick demonstration to show how the `sanitize_input` method works with a variety of inputs:

Perfect! Let me verify the final implementation by reading the updated file:

## Task 2 Complete! 

I have successfully implemented Task 2: **Complete Implementation of `sanitize_input` Method in `PromptSanitizer` Class**. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

### ✅ Implementation Completed

1. **Fully implemented the `sanitize_input` method** in the `PromptSanitizer` class with the following features:
   - **Forbidden Pattern Removal**: Uses the compiled regex patterns from Task 1 to detect and remove prompt injection attempts
   - **Basic Character Removal**: Removes dangerous characters like `<>{}\[\];|`'"` that could be used for injection attacks
   - **HTML Character Escaping**: Uses `html.escape()` to properly escape HTML/XML special characters
   - **Whitespace Normalization**: Converts multiple whitespace characters to single spaces and trims
   - **Input Truncation**: Limits input to a configurable maximum length (default: 2048 characters)

2. **Enhanced forbidden patterns** to be more comprehensive:
   - Added `r"forget\s+(everything|all)"` to catch general forget commands
   - Updated `r"you\s+are\s+now\s+a\s+\w+"` to capture role-playing attempts with any word following

3. **Added comprehensive unit tests** covering:
   - Clean text preservation
   - Forbidden pattern removal (single and multiple)
   - Dangerous character removal
   - HTML character escaping
   - Whitespace normalization
   - Input truncation (default and custom lengths)
   - Edge cases (empty strings, non-string inputs)
   - Complex malicious input combinations
   - Case-insensitive pattern matching
   - Legitimate content preservation

### ✅ Key Features

- **Multi-step sanitization process** that sequentially applies all security measures
- **45 comprehensive regex patterns** for detecting various prompt injection techniques
- **Case-insensitive pattern matching** using `re.IGNORECASE` flag
- **Configurable maximum length** with default of 2048 characters
- **Proper type checking** with return of empty string for non-string inputs
- **Comprehensive documentation** with detailed docstrings and type hints

### ✅ Test Results

All 25 tests pass successfully, including:
- 4 tests for initialization verification
- 12 tests for the new `sanitize_input` method functionality 
- 9 existing tests for the original utility functions

The implementation successfully handles complex attack vectors while preserving legitimate content, providing robust protection against prompt injection attacks as specified in the PRD requirements.

**User**

Do we need to remove the old sanitize_input function that is not wrapped in the class? If so, we need to search the codebase and make replacements.

---

**Cursor**

You raise an excellent point! Looking at the current code, we have both the new `PromptSanitizer.sanitize_input` method and the old standalone `sanitize_input` function. Let me search the codebase to see where the old function is being used and determine if we need to replace those usages.

Great! I found that the old `sanitize_input` function is being used in several places. Let me look specifically at the main usage in the text processor service:

Now let me check the `sanitize_options` function to see if it's also using the old `sanitize_input`:

Yes, I can see that:

1. **The old `sanitize_input` function is being used** in `backend/app/services/text_processor.py` (lines 184, 186)
2. **The `sanitize_options` function uses the old `sanitize_input`** (line 154)
3. **Tests are importing and testing both** the old and new functions

Let me check if there are any other services using the old function:

Perfect! Now I have a clear picture. The old `sanitize_input` function is being used in:

1. **`backend/app/services/text_processor.py`** - Main usage for sanitizing user inputs
2. **`backend/app/utils/sanitization.py`** - In the `sanitize_options` function (line 154)
3. **Tests** - Multiple test files are importing and testing both versions

**We should replace these usages with the new `PromptSanitizer` class** because:
- The new implementation is much more secure (45 advanced patterns vs basic character removal)
- It provides better protection against prompt injection attacks
- It's the intended approach as specified in the PRD

Let me create a plan to migrate:

1. **Update `sanitize_options` function** to use `PromptSanitizer`
2. **Update `text_processor.py`** to use `PromptSanitizer`
3. **Update imports and tests** accordingly
4. **Remove the old `sanitize_input` function** once all usages are replaced

Let's start with updating the `sanitize_options` function:

Excellent! Now I've made the changes so that:

1. **The old `sanitize_input` function now uses `PromptSanitizer` under the hood** - this provides backward compatibility
2. **The `sanitize_options` function uses the global `PromptSanitizer` instance** directly
3. **All existing code will automatically get the enhanced security** without needing changes

Now let's test to make sure everything still works:

I see the issue! The existing tests were written for the old basic `sanitize_input` function, but now it's using the advanced `PromptSanitizer` which has different behavior:

1. **Different character handling**: The new sanitizer removes more characters and handles HTML escaping 
2. **Different max_length**: The old default was 1024, but the new default is 2048

Let me update these legacy tests to match the new behavior, or better yet, let me check if we can adjust the backward compatibility function to be closer to the old behavior while still providing the security benefits:

**User**

still working?

**Cursor**

Yes, I'm still working on this! I was in the middle of resolving test failures after migrating to use the new `PromptSanitizer`. The issue is that the legacy tests expect the old basic sanitization behavior, but now we're using the much more advanced security-focused sanitization.

Let me fix the failing tests by updating them to match the new, more secure behavior:
