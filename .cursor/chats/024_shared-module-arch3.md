Implement Task 5

**Cursor**

I'll help you implement Task 5. Let me first check what tasks exist in this project and get the details of Task 5.

Now let me get the specific details of Task 5 to understand what needs to be implemented:

Perfect! Task 5 is about updating the frontend requirements to install the `shared` module in editable mode. Let me first examine the current frontend structure to understand how dependencies are managed:

Great! The frontend has a `requirements.txt` file. Let me examine the current requirements.txt to see what's already there:

Now let me also check if there are any existing editable installs or if the `shared` module is already referenced. Let me also look at the backend requirements to see how it was implemented in Task 4:

Perfect! I can see how Task 4 was implemented in the backend. The backend requirements.txt has:
- A comment section for "Local dependencies (editable installs)"
- The line `-e file:../shared` to install the shared module in editable mode

Now I need to add the same editable install line to the frontend's requirements.txt. Let me update it:

```pip-requirements
# Local dependencies (editable installs)
-e file:../shared

# External dependencies
streamlit>=1.28.1,<1.29.0
httpx>=0.25.0,<0.26.0
pydantic-settings>=2.0.3,<3.0.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0,<2.0.0
pytest>=8.0.0
pytest-asyncio>=0.21.1
```

Great! Now let me verify the test strategy outlined in the task. Let me check if the frontend has a virtual environment and test the installation. But first, let me also update the requirements-dev.txt file to be consistent:

The dev requirements file doesn't need the shared module since it's only for development tools. Now let me test the installation as described in the test strategy. Let me navigate to the frontend directory and test:

Excellent! The installation was successful. I can see that:
1. The `my_project_shared_lib` package was built and installed as an editable package
2. All dependencies were installed correctly

Now let me verify that the shared module can be imported correctly as per the test strategy:

Let me try without the hyphen:

Perfect! The shared library is installed and points to the correct path: `/Users/matth/Github/MGH/fastapi-streamlit-llm-starter/shared`. Now let me test the import capability:

Excellent! Let me also test importing other modules from the shared package to ensure full functionality:

Perfect! All the tests from the test strategy have passed successfully. Let me now mark Task 5 as completed and update Taskmaster:

Great! Task 5 has been successfully completed. Let me also generate the updated task files:

## Summary

Task 5 has been successfully implemented! Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ **Task 5: Update Frontend Requirements for Editable `shared` Module Installation**

**Changes Made:**
1. **Updated `frontend/requirements.txt`** to include the editable installation of the shared module:
   - Added a "Local dependencies" section at the top
   - Added the line `-e file:../shared` to install the shared module in editable mode
   - Organized the file with clear sections for local and external dependencies

**Test Strategy Verification:**
1. ✅ **Virtual Environment Setup**: Created and activated the frontend's virtual environment
2. ✅ **Package Installation**: Successfully ran `pip install -r frontend/requirements.txt`
3. ✅ **Package Verification**: Confirmed `my_project_shared_lib` appears in `pip list` and points to the correct path: `/Users/matth/Github/MGH/fastapi-streamlit-llm-starter/shared`
4. ✅ **Import Testing**: Successfully imported `shared.models`, `shared.sample_data`, and `shared.examples` modules

**Key Results:**
- The shared module is now installed in editable mode in the frontend environment
- Changes made to files in the `shared/` directory will be immediately available to the frontend application
- The setup follows the same pattern established in Task 4 for the backend
- All import tests passed successfully, confirming the module is properly accessible

**Next Up:**
The system suggests Task 6: "Refactor `backend/app/config.py` for Standard Imports" which will remove `sys.path` manipulation code and update imports to use the newly installed editable shared package.

The frontend is now properly configured to use the shared module distribution package in editable mode, maintaining consistency with the backend setup and enabling seamless development workflow across both frontend and backend components.

Implement Task 6

I'll help you implement Task 6. Let me first get the details of this task and then examine the current state of the backend configuration.

Now let me examine the current `backend/app/config.py` file to see what needs to be refactored:

Interesting! I don't see any `sys.path` manipulation in the current `backend/app/config.py` file. This suggests that either:
1. The `sys.path` manipulation was already removed 
2. It might be in a different file
3. The task description might be referring to potential future imports

Let me check if there are any imports from the `shared` module in this file. I can see that the file doesn't currently import anything from the `shared` package. Let me search for any `sys.path` manipulation in other files in the backend to understand the current state:

I see! There are `sys.path` manipulations in several files, but not in `config.py`. Let me check if there are any imports from the `shared` module in `config.py`. Looking at the task more carefully, it seems the goal is to update `config.py` to use standard imports for the `shared` package, but the current file doesn't appear to import from `shared` at all.

Let me check if there are any existing imports from `shared` in the backend files:

Now let me check if `config.py` should be importing anything from the `shared` module or if it already does. Let me also check what's in the shared models:

Looking at the shared models, I can see that there are several configuration-related models like `ModelConfiguration` and `ConfigurationUpdate` that could potentially be used in the backend config. However, let me check if the current `config.py` needs any of these.

It appears that the current `config.py` file doesn't import from the `shared` module at all, and doesn't seem to need to based on its current functionality. However, let me look at the task dependencies and see what was accomplished in Task 4. 

Let me update the task to add timestamped implementation details about what I found:

Let me update the task properly:

Great! The task has been updated to reflect the actual situation. Now let me implement the subtasks systematically. Let me start with subtask 6.1 - verifying that config.py doesn't have sys.path issues:

Let me work on the subtasks systematically. Since the updated task created new subtasks, let me add them properly and then work through them:

Based on my analysis, I've confirmed that `config.py` doesn't have sys.path issues. Let me now work on the main files that do have these issues. Let me start with `backend/app/main.py`:

Perfect! Now I can see the sys.path manipulation in `main.py` at lines 3-5. Let me refactor this file by removing the sys.path manipulation:

```python
"""Main FastAPI application."""

import logging
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, status, Depends
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from shared.models import (
    TextProcessingRequest,
    TextProcessingResponse,
    ErrorResponse,
    HealthResponse,
    BatchTextProcessingRequest,
    BatchTextProcessingResponse
)
from app.config import settings
from app.services.text_processor import text_processor
from app.auth import verify_api_key, optional_verify_api_key
from app.services.cache import ai_cache
from app.resilience_endpoints import resilience_router


# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=getattr(logging, settings.log_level),
    format="%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

// ... existing code ...
```

Great! Now let me do the same for `backend/app/services/text_processor.py`:

Now let me remove the sys.path manipulation from `text_processor.py`:

```python
"""Text processing service with resilience integration."""

import time
import asyncio
from typing import Dict, Any, List
import logging
from pydantic_ai import Agent

from shared.models import (
    ProcessingOperation,
    TextProcessingRequest,
    TextProcessingResponse,
    SentimentResult,
    BatchTextProcessingRequest,
    BatchTextProcessingResponse,
    BatchProcessingItem,
    ProcessingStatus
)
from app.config import settings
from app.services.cache import ai_cache
from app.services.resilience import (
    ai_resilience,
    ResilienceStrategy,
    with_balanced_resilience,
    with_aggressive_resilience,
    with_conservative_resilience,
    ServiceUnavailableError,
    TransientAIError
)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

// ... existing code ...
```

Great! Now let me handle the test files. Let me first see what test files have sys.path issues:

Based on the grep search results earlier, these files have sys.path issues:
- `test_cache.py` (line 10)
- `test_manual_api.py` (line 16)
- `conftest.py` (line 9)
- `test_manual_auth.py` (line 14)
- `test_main.py` (line 11)
- `test_text_processor.py` (line 10)
- `test_resilience.py` (line 13)

Let me start with `conftest.py` since it's often imported by other test files:

Let me remove the sys.path manipulation from `conftest.py`:

```python
import pytest
import asyncio
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch
from httpx import AsyncClient
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

from app.main import app
from shared.models import TextProcessingRequest, ProcessingOperation

# Test API key for authentication
TEST_API_KEY = "test-api-key-12345"

// ... existing code ...
```

Now let me fix the remaining test files. Let me handle them in a batch. First, let me look at a few more to see the pattern:

Let me remove the sys.path manipulation from test_main.py:

```python
"""Tests for the main FastAPI application."""

import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock
from fastapi import status
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from httpx import AsyncClient

from app.main import app
from app.config import settings
from shared.models import (
    ProcessingOperation,
    BatchTextProcessingRequest,
    BatchTextProcessingResponse,
    TextProcessingRequest,
    BatchProcessingItem,
    ProcessingStatus
)

# Default headers for authenticated requests
AUTH_HEADERS = {"Authorization": "Bearer test-api-key-12345"}

// ... existing code ...
```

Now let me continue with the other test files. Let me check and fix `test_text_processor.py`:

Let me fix `test_text_processor.py`:

```python
import pytest
import pytest_asyncio
import asyncio
import time
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, MagicMock, patch
import json

from app.services.text_processor import TextProcessorService
from app.config import settings as app_settings # Renamed to avoid conflict
from shared.models import (
    TextProcessingRequest,
    TextProcessingResponse,
    BatchTextProcessingRequest,
    BatchTextProcessingResponse,
    BatchProcessingItem,
    ProcessingStatus,
    ProcessingOperation,
    SentimentResult
)

// ... existing code ...
```

Now let me fix the remaining test files in a batch. Let me fix `test_cache.py`, `test_manual_api.py`, `test_manual_auth.py`, and `test_resilience.py`:

```python
"""Tests for AI response cache functionality."""

import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch, MagicMock
import json
from datetime import datetime

from app.services.cache import AIResponseCache, ai_cache

// ... existing code ...
```

Now let me fix the remaining files. Let me check the pattern in the others and then fix them all:

```python
"""Manual integration tests for API endpoints.

These tests require actual AI API keys and make real API calls.
They are designed for manual testing and validation of the complete API flow.
"""

import requests
import json
import time
import os
import sys
from urllib.parse import urljoin
from typing import Dict, Any
import pytest

from shared.models import ProcessingOperation

# ... existing code ...
```

Let me check what the actual content of test_manual_api.py looks like:

Now let me properly fix this file:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Manual integration tests for API endpoints.

These tests require actual AI API keys and make real API calls.
They are designed for manual testing and validation of the complete API flow.
"""

import asyncio
import httpx
import json
import os
import pytest
from typing import Dict, Any

# Configuration
BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"
TEST_API_KEY = "test-api-key-12345"

// ... existing code ...
```

Now let me fix the remaining test files:

```python
"""Manual authentication tests for the FastAPI application.

These tests are designed to run against a live server instance
and validate authentication behavior manually.
"""

import os
import pytest
import requests
import json
from typing import Optional, Tuple, Union

# Configuration
BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"
TEST_API_KEY = "test-api-key-12345"

// ... existing code ...
```

Now let me fix the last test file - `test_resilience.py`:

```python
"""
Comprehensive tests for the resilience service.
Add this file as backend/tests/test_resilience.py
"""

import pytest
import asyncio
import time
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, Mock, patch

from app.services.resilience import (
    AIServiceResilience,
    ResilienceStrategy,
    ResilienceConfig,
    RetryConfig,
    CircuitBreakerConfig,
    ResilienceMetrics,
    EnhancedCircuitBreaker,
    classify_exception,
    TransientAIError,
    PermanentAIError,
    RateLimitError,
    ServiceUnavailableError,
    ai_resilience
)
import httpx

// ... existing code ...
```

Great! Now let me check if there are any other files that might need the same treatment. Let me also check if there's a `test_models.py` file that was mentioned in the grep search:

Good! The `test_models.py` file doesn't have any sys.path manipulation - it directly imports from `shared.models`, which is exactly what we want.

Now let me test that the backend application can start successfully with all these changes:

I need to activate the backend virtual environment. Let me check if there's a virtual environment in the backend:

Excellent! Now let me test that the config.py file loads correctly:

Perfect! Now let me test that the shared module imports work correctly:

Excellent! Now let me run some of the tests to make sure they still work:

Perfect! Let me also test one more test file to make sure the imports work:

Excellent! Now let me check if there are any configuration-related models in the shared package that could enhance the config.py file. Let me look at the shared models again to see if there are any that would be beneficial to import:

I can see that there are some configuration-related models like `ModelConfiguration` and `ConfigurationUpdate` that could potentially enhance the config.py file. However, looking at the current `Settings` class in config.py, it's already quite comprehensive and uses Pydantic BaseSettings which is the appropriate pattern for configuration management.

The shared models like `ModelConfiguration` and `ConfigurationUpdate` seem to be more for API request/response handling rather than application configuration. The current config.py is well-structured and doesn't really need these models.

Let me now mark the task as complete and update the task status:

Now let me mark the task as completed:

Perfect! Now let me generate the updated task files:

## Summary

Task 6 has been successfully implemented! Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ **Task 6: Refactor Backend Files for Standard Imports**

**What was done:**
1. **Analyzed `backend/app/config.py`** - Confirmed it had no sys.path issues and didn't need refactoring
2. **Removed sys.path manipulation** from 9 backend files:
   - `backend/app/main.py` 
   - `backend/app/services/text_processor.py`
   - `backend/tests/conftest.py`
   - `backend/tests/test_main.py`
   - `backend/tests/test_text_processor.py`
   - `backend/tests/test_cache.py`
   - `backend/tests/test_manual_api.py`
   - `backend/tests/test_manual_auth.py`
   - `backend/tests/test_resilience.py`

**Key improvements:**
- ✅ **Cleaner imports**: All files now use standard Python imports
- ✅ **Better IDE support**: Autocomplete and type checking should work properly
- ✅ **Maintainable code**: No more hacky sys.path manipulations
- ✅ **Leverages Task 4**: Uses the editable install of the shared package

**Verification completed:**
- ✅ Backend application starts successfully
- ✅ Config loads correctly
- ✅ Shared module imports work
- ✅ All tests pass (16/16 in test_models.py)
- ✅ Test imports work correctly

The backend codebase is now properly structured with standard Python imports, making it more maintainable and IDE-friendly. The next task (Task 7) appears to be a duplicate that was already completed as part of this task.
