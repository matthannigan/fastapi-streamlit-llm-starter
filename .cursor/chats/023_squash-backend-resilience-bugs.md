I can see there's an error with the `EnhancedCircuitBreaker` implementation. The error indicates that the circuit breaker object is missing a `current_state` attribute. Let me investigate the circuit breaker code to identify and fix the issue.

Now let me look at the specific line where the error is occurring - the circuit breaker is trying to access `current_state` but it seems this attribute doesn't exist:

I found the issue! The problem is that the `EnhancedCircuitBreaker` class is trying to access `current_state`, but the standard `circuitbreaker` library uses a different attribute name. Let me check the circuitbreaker library documentation to see the correct attribute name:

Perfect! I found the issue. The problem is that the `circuitbreaker` library uses `_state` as the internal attribute name, not `current_state`. Let me check what's being used in the code by looking at the specific circuit breaker usage:

Now let me check what the actual attribute name should be by looking at the CircuitBreaker source code:

Perfect! I can see that the CircuitBreaker has both `_state` (internal) and `state` (public) attributes. The code is incorrectly using `current_state` which doesn't exist. Let me check what the `state` attribute returns:

Great! The correct attribute is `state`, not `current_state`. Now let me fix all the occurrences in the code:

```python
                    # Apply circuit breaker if enabled
                    if circuit_breaker:
                        # Check if circuit breaker is open
                        if circuit_breaker.state == 'open':
                            if fallback:
                                logger.warning(f"Circuit breaker open for {operation_name}, using fallback")
                                return await fallback(*args, **kwargs)
                            else:
                                raise ServiceUnavailableError(
                                    f"Service {operation_name} is currently unavailable (circuit breaker open)"
                                )
```

Now let me fix the test file:

```python
        # Circuit breaker should now be open
        cb = resilience_service.circuit_breakers.get("test_circuit")
        if cb:
            # Depending on timing, circuit might be open
            assert cb.state in ["open", "closed"]
```

Now let me fix the resilience endpoints file:

```python
        breaker = ai_resilience.circuit_breakers[breaker_name]
        return {
            "name": breaker_name,
            "state": breaker.state,
            "failure_count": breaker.failure_count,
            "failure_threshold": breaker.failure_threshold,
            "recovery_timeout": breaker.recovery_timeout,
            "last_failure_time": breaker.last_failure_time,
            "metrics": breaker.metrics.to_dict() if hasattr(breaker, 'metrics') else {}
        }
```

Let me check if there are any other occurrences in that file:

There's still one more occurrence. Let me find and fix it:

I found it! It's on line 180. Let me fix that:

```python
        return {
            "message": f"Circuit breaker '{breaker_name}' has been reset",
            "name": breaker_name,
            "new_state": breaker.state
        }
```

Now let me verify there are no more occurrences:

Perfect! Now let's test the fix by restarting the backend and trying the request again:

Let's wait a moment for the backend to fully start up and then check if it's working:

The request is still failing, but let's check the logs to see if the circuit breaker error is fixed and identify the new issue:

Great! The circuit breaker issue is fixed (we can see it's properly checking the state now), but there's a new issue: `classify_exception() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given`. This is coming from the tenacity retry configuration where the `classify_exception` function signature doesn't match what tenacity expects.

Let me check the `classify_exception` function:

The issue is that `tenacity` expects the retry function to accept a retry state object, not just the exception. Let me check how the `classify_exception` function is being used in the retry decorator:

I see the issue! The `retry` parameter in tenacity expects a predicate function that accepts the retry state, not just the exception. I need to fix the `classify_exception` function to work with tenacity. Let me check the tenacity documentation for the correct signature:

did you get stuck?

No, I wasn't stuck! I was in the middle of fixing the circuit breaker issues. I successfully fixed the first issue (the `current_state` attribute error), but there's still a second issue to resolve: the `classify_exception` function signature doesn't match what tenacity expects.

The error `classify_exception() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given` occurs because tenacity's `retry` parameter expects a function that accepts a retry state object, not just the exception.

Let me fix this:

```python
def classify_exception(exc: Exception) -> bool:
    """
    Classify whether an exception should trigger retries.
    
    Returns True if the exception is transient and should be retried.
    """
    # Network and connection errors (should retry)
    if isinstance(exc, (
        httpx.ConnectError,
        httpx.TimeoutException,
        httpx.NetworkError,
        ConnectionError,
        TimeoutError,
        TransientAIError,
        RateLimitError,
        ServiceUnavailableError
    )):
        return True
    
    # HTTP errors that should be retried
    if isinstance(exc, httpx.HTTPStatusError):
        status_code = exc.response.status_code
        # Retry on server errors and rate limits
        if status_code in (429, 500, 502, 503, 504):
            return True
        # Don't retry on client errors
        if 400 <= status_code < 500:
            return False
    
    # Permanent errors (should not retry)
    if isinstance(exc, (
        PermanentAIError,
        ValueError,
        TypeError,
        AttributeError
    )):
        return False
    
    # Default: retry on unknown exceptions (conservative approach)
    return True


def should_retry_on_exception(retry_state) -> bool:
    """
    Tenacity-compatible function to determine if an exception should trigger a retry.
    
    Args:
        retry_state: Tenacity retry state object containing exception information
        
    Returns:
        True if the exception should trigger a retry
    """
    if hasattr(retry_state, 'outcome') and retry_state.outcome.failed:
        exception = retry_state.outcome.exception()
        return classify_exception(exception)
    return False
```

Now I need to update the retry decorator to use the new function:

```python
                retry_decorator = retry(
                    stop=stop_strategy,
                    wait=wait_strategy,
                    retry=should_retry_on_exception,
                    before_sleep=self.custom_before_sleep(operation_name),
                    reraise=True
                )
```

Now let's restart the backend and test the fix:

Let's wait a moment for the backend to start and then test the endpoint:

Excellent! The fix worked perfectly! ðŸŽ‰ 

Let's also check the backend logs to confirm everything is working smoothly:

Perfect! The logs show everything is working correctly now. The request completed successfully without any errors.

## Summary

I successfully fixed both circuit breaker issues:

### âœ… **Issue 1 Fixed**: `'EnhancedCircuitBreaker' object has no attribute 'current_state'`
- **Problem**: The code was using `current_state` attribute which doesn't exist in the `circuitbreaker` library
- **Solution**: Changed all references from `current_state` to `state` (the correct attribute name)
- **Files updated**: 
  - `backend/app/services/resilience.py`
  - `backend/tests/test_resilience.py` 
  - `backend/app/resilience_endpoints.py`

### âœ… **Issue 2 Fixed**: `classify_exception() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given`
- **Problem**: Tenacity's `retry` parameter expects a function that accepts a retry state object, but `classify_exception` was designed to accept just the exception
- **Solution**: Created a new `should_retry_on_exception` function that wraps `classify_exception` and accepts the retry state object as expected by tenacity
- **Implementation**: The new function extracts the exception from the retry state and passes it to the original classification logic

### ðŸŽ¯ **Result**
The API is now working correctly:
- Circuit breaker functionality is operational
- Retry mechanism works as expected  
- The `/process` endpoint successfully processes text and returns proper results
- No more errors in the logs

The resilience service is now properly integrated and working as intended, providing robust error handling and circuit breaker protection for AI operations.
