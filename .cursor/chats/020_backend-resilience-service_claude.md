Now let me create an environment configuration example and test file:

Finally, let me create a comprehensive test file for the resilience service:

## Summary

I've created a comprehensive resilience service for your backend using `tenacity` and `circuitbreaker`. Here's what I've provided:

### 🔧 **Enhanced Resilience Service**
- **Configurable strategies**: Aggressive, Balanced, Conservative, and Critical
- **Smart exception classification**: Automatically determines which errors should trigger retries
- **Circuit breaker integration**: Protects against cascading failures
- **Comprehensive metrics**: Tracks success rates, retry attempts, and circuit breaker state changes
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Provides graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### 📊 **Key Features**
1. **Operation-specific resilience**: Different strategies for different AI operations (summarization vs Q&A)
2. **Exponential backoff with jitter**: Prevents thundering herd problems
3. **Circuit breaker monitoring**: Tracks state transitions and provides health checks
4. **Comprehensive metrics**: Success rates, failure counts, retry attempts
5. **Environment-driven configuration**: All settings configurable via environment variables

### 🎯 **Resilience Strategies**
- **Aggressive**: Fast retries (2 attempts), quick circuit breaker (3 failures) - for real-time operations
- **Balanced**: Standard retries (3 attempts), normal circuit breaker (5 failures) - default strategy  
- **Conservative**: More retries (5 attempts), patient circuit breaker (8 failures) - for complex operations
- **Critical**: Maximum retries (7 attempts), very patient circuit breaker (10 failures) - mission-critical

### 🔍 **Monitoring & Management**
- REST endpoints for metrics, health checks, and circuit breaker management
- Dashboard view for operational monitoring
- Individual operation metrics and circuit breaker status
- Reset capabilities for metrics and circuit breakers

### 🚀 **Integration Points**
- **Updated text processor**: Integrates resilience decorators for each AI operation
- **Configuration management**: Environment variable support for all settings
- **Cache integration**: Works with existing caching mechanisms
- **Fallback responses**: Provides cached or default responses when AI is unavailable

### 📋 **To Use This Implementation**

1. **Add the resilience service** to `backend/app/services/resilience.py`
2. **Update your configuration** with the enhanced settings
3. **Replace your text processor** with the resilience-integrated version
4. **Add monitoring endpoints** to your main FastAPI application
5. **Update your .env file** with the resilience configuration options
6. **Run the tests** to ensure everything works correctly

The implementation provides production-ready resilience patterns that will help your AI service handle failures gracefully, provide better user experience during outages, and give you comprehensive monitoring of service health.
