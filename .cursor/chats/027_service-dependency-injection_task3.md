Execute Task 3: Implement `get_settings` Provider

**Cursor**

I'll help you execute Task 3: Implement `get_settings` Provider. Let me first check the current task management system and find the details for Task 3.

Now let me check if the dependencies are completed and examine the current project structure to understand the implementation context.

Great! Dependencies 1 and 2 are completed. Now let me examine the current state of the files to understand what needs to be implemented.

Excellent! I can see that Task 3 is actually already implemented. The `get_settings` function exists in `backend/app/dependencies.py` with the proper implementation using `@lru_cache()` and returning a `Settings` instance. 

Let me run the tests to verify that this implementation works correctly and then mark the task as complete.

Let me check if there are any existing tests for the dependencies:

Let me check if there are any tests for dependencies in the main test files:

Perfect! Let me look at the actual tests to verify the implementation is properly tested:

Excellent! I can see that the implementation is complete and thoroughly tested. The tests verify:

1. ✅ `get_settings()` returns a `Settings` instance
2. ✅ `lru_cache` behavior is tested by verifying the same instance is returned on multiple calls 
3. ✅ Additional test for `get_fresh_settings()` as an alternative provider

Let me run the tests to make sure everything is working correctly:

Perfect! Both tests are passing. Let me also run all the dependency provider tests to ensure everything works together:

Excellent! All tests are passing. Now let me update the task status to reflect that Task 3 has been completed and add a note about the verification:

Now let me mark Task 3 as completed:

Perfect! Task 3 has been successfully completed. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## ✅ Task 3: Implement `get_settings` Provider - COMPLETED

### Summary
Task 3 has been successfully executed and verified. The `get_settings` dependency provider was already implemented in `backend/app/dependencies.py` with all the requirements met and exceeded.

### Implementation Details
The implementation includes:

**1. Core `get_settings` Function:**
```12:16:backend/app/dependencies.py
@lru_cache()
def get_settings() -> Settings:
    """
    Dependency provider for application settings.
    
    Uses lru_cache to ensure the same Settings instance is returned
    across all dependency injections, improving performance and
    ensuring consistent configuration throughout the application.
    
    Returns:
        Settings: The application settings instance
    """
    return settings
```

**2. Additional `get_fresh_settings` Function:**
```19:28:backend/app/dependencies.py
def get_fresh_settings() -> Settings:
    """
    Dependency provider that creates a fresh Settings instance.
    
    This is useful for testing scenarios where you might want to
    override environment variables or provide different configurations.
    
    Returns:
        Settings: A fresh Settings instance
    """
    return Settings()
```

### ✅ Requirements Fulfilled
- **`@lru_cache()` decorator**: ✅ Implemented for efficiency
- **Returns `Settings` instance**: ✅ Returns the global settings instance
- **Proper imports**: ✅ Uses `from app.config import Settings`
- **Type hints**: ✅ Proper return type annotation

### ✅ Test Coverage Verified
All tests passed with 100% success rate:
- `test_get_settings_returns_settings_instance()` - Confirms correct return type
- `test_get_settings_cached()` - Verifies `lru_cache` behavior (same instance returned)
- `test_get_fresh_settings_returns_new_instance()` - Tests alternative provider
- `test_get_fresh_settings_with_parameter_override()` - Tests flexibility

### Next Task Available
The system has automatically identified **Task 4: Refactor `AIResponseCache` for Injectable Configuration** as the next task to work on, which depends on the completed Task 2.

Task 3 is now complete and ready for use throughout the FastAPI application as a dependency injection provider for application settings.

```python
@lru_cache()
def get_settings() -> Settings:
    """
    Dependency provider for application settings.
    
    Uses lru_cache to ensure the same Settings instance is returned
    across all dependency injections, improving performance and
    ensuring consistent configuration throughout the application.
    
    Returns:
        Settings: The application settings instance
    """
    return settings
```

```python
def get_fresh_settings() -> Settings:
    """
    Dependency provider that creates a fresh Settings instance.
    
    This is useful for testing scenarios where you might want to
    override environment variables or provide different configurations.
    
    Returns:
        Settings: A fresh Settings instance
    """
    return Settings()
```
