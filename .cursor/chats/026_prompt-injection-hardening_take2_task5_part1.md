Execute Task 5

**Cursor**

I'll help you execute Task 5. Let me start by checking the task dependencies and examining the current codebase structure.

Great! I can see that both dependencies (Task 2 and Task 4) are marked as "done". Now let me examine the current `text_processor.py` file to understand its current implementation and what needs to be updated.

Let me also check the specific methods that need to be updated to see how they currently handle sanitization and prompt building:

Now let me check what the current `PromptSanitizer` and `create_safe_prompt` implementations look like:

Now let me start implementing Task 5 by updating the text_processor.py file. I can see that:

1. The current code uses `sanitize_input_advanced` from `backend/app/utils/sanitization.py`
2. It manually constructs prompts with delimiters, similar to the structured approach but not using the `create_safe_prompt` function
3. I need to replace this with `PromptSanitizer.sanitize_input` and `create_safe_prompt`

Let's start with subtask 5.1 - importing the new security modules:

Now let's update the imports and add the sanitizer instantiation:

```python
"""Text processing service with resilience integration."""

import time
import asyncio
from typing import Dict, Any, List
import logging
from pydantic_ai import Agent

from shared.models import (
    ProcessingOperation,
    TextProcessingRequest,
    TextProcessingResponse,
    SentimentResult,
    BatchTextProcessingRequest,
    BatchTextProcessingResponse,
    BatchProcessingItem,
    ProcessingStatus
)
from app.config import settings
from app.services.cache import ai_cache
from app.utils.sanitization import sanitize_input, sanitize_input_advanced, sanitize_options, PromptSanitizer # Enhanced import
from app.services.prompt_builder import create_safe_prompt
from app.services.resilience import (
    ai_resilience,
    ResilienceStrategy,
    with_balanced_resilience,
    with_aggressive_resilience,
    with_conservative_resilience,
    ServiceUnavailableError,
    TransientAIError
)
from app.security.response_validator import validate_ai_response

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class TextProcessorService:
    """Service for processing text using AI models with resilience patterns."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the text processor with AI agent and resilience."""
        if not settings.gemini_api_key:
            raise ValueError("GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable is required")
            
        self.agent = Agent(
            model=settings.ai_model,
            system_prompt="You are a helpful AI assistant specialized in text analysis.",
        )
        
        # Initialize the advanced sanitizer
        self.sanitizer = PromptSanitizer()
        
        # Configure resilience strategies for different operations
        self._configure_resilience_strategies()
```

Great! Now let's mark subtask 5.1 as done and move to subtask 5.2:

Now let's work on subtask 5.2 - replacing basic sanitization with `PromptSanitizer.sanitize_input`:

Let me read the specific section where sanitization is happening:

Now I can see the exact lines where the sanitization is happening. Let me update those lines:

```python
        # Sanitize inputs for processing with enhanced security for AI operations
        # Use advanced sanitization for text going to AI models to prevent prompt injection
        sanitized_text = self.sanitizer.sanitize_input(request.text)
        sanitized_options = sanitize_options(request.options or {})
        sanitized_question = self.sanitizer.sanitize_input(request.question) if request.question else None
```

Perfect! Now let's mark subtask 5.2 as done and move to subtask 5.3:

Now let's work on subtask 5.3 - replacing ad-hoc prompt formatting with `create_safe_prompt`. I need to analyze the current prompt construction in various methods:

Let me check what templates are currently available in the prompt builder:

I can see that the current templates are:
1. "summarize" - perfect for `_summarize_text`
2. "analyze" - might work for `_analyze_sentiment` and `_extract_key_points`
3. "question_answer" - perfect for `_answer_question`

However, I notice the existing methods have more specific requirements that might not map perfectly to the existing templates. Let me add some new templates to better match the existing functionality. But first, let me start with the summarize method which should map perfectly:

```python
    async def _summarize_text(self, text: str, options: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        """Summarize the provided text."""
        # Options are sanitized by process_text before being passed here or to the _with_resilience wrapper
        max_length = options.get("max_length", 100)
        
        # User text is already pre-sanitized by process_text
        additional_instructions = f"Keep the summary to approximately {max_length} words."
        
        prompt = create_safe_prompt(
            template_name="summarize",
            user_input=text,
            additional_instructions=additional_instructions
        )
        
        try:
            result = await self.agent.run(prompt)
            # Pass the original `text` (sanitized user input) and the specific `system_instruction` for this call
            try:
                validated_output = validate_ai_response(result.data.strip(), 'summary', text, "summarization")
                return validated_output
            except ValueError as ve:
                logger.error(f"AI response validation failed in summarization: {ve}. Problematic response: {result.data.strip()[:200]}...")
                return "An error occurred while processing your request. The AI response could not be validated."
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"AI agent error in summarization: {e}")
            # Convert to our custom exception for proper retry handling
            raise TransientAIError(f"Failed to summarize text: {str(e)}")
```

Perfect! Now I need to add templates for the other methods. Let me add the missing templates to the prompt_builder.py file:

```python
# Template dictionary with structured prompt templates
PROMPT_TEMPLATES: Dict[str, str] = {
    "summarize": """<system_instruction>

Please analyze the following user-provided text and create a clear summary that captures the key points.

    "sentiment": """<system_instruction>

    "key_points": """<system_instruction>

}
```

Now I need to update the `create_safe_prompt` function to handle the special case where the question_answer template needs a `user_question` parameter:

```python
def create_safe_prompt(template_name: str, user_input: str, **kwargs) -> str:
    """
    Create a safe prompt by combining a template with escaped user input.
    
    This function retrieves the specified template, escapes the user input to prevent

    Args:

        user_input (str): Raw user input to be escaped and embedded in the template
        **kwargs: Additional arguments to format into the template
                 For question_answer template, use user_question="question text"
        
    Returns:

    Raises:

    """
    # Validate template name
    if template_name not in PROMPT_TEMPLATES:
        available_templates = list(PROMPT_TEMPLATES.keys())
        raise ValueError(
            f"Unknown template name '{template_name}'. "
            f"Available templates: {available_templates}"
        )
    
    # Get the template
    template = PROMPT_TEMPLATES[template_name]
    
    # Escape user input for safety
    escaped_input = escape_user_input(user_input)
    
    # Prepare formatting arguments
    format_args = {

        format_args["user_question"] = escape_user_input(kwargs["user_question"])
    
    try:
        # Format the template with escaped input and additional arguments
        formatted_prompt = template.format(**format_args)
        return formatted_prompt.strip()
    except KeyError as e:
        raise KeyError(
            f"Missing required placeholder {e} for template '{template_name}'. "
            f"Available placeholders in template: {_get_template_placeholders(template)}"
        )
```

Now let me update all the remaining methods in text_processor.py to use the new templates:

```python
    async def _analyze_sentiment(self, text: str) -> SentimentResult:
        """Analyze sentiment of the provided text."""
        # User text is already pre-sanitized

        )
        
        try:

            raw_output = result.data.strip()

Excellent! Now let's mark subtask 5.3 as done and move to subtask 5.4:

Now let's work on subtask 5.4 - removing obsolete sanitization/formatting code. Since I've already replaced all the manual prompt construction with `create_safe_prompt` calls, the main cleanup needed is to remove any unused imports or variables:

Let me check if there are any unused imports or obsolete code that needs to be cleaned up:

I can see that the imports still include `sanitize_input` and `sanitize_input_advanced` which are no longer used in the main processing methods. However, I need to check if they're used elsewhere in the file. Let me search for their usage:

Good! I can see that:
1. `sanitize_input_advanced` is only in the import line and not used anywhere else
2. `sanitize_input` is also only in the import line and not used anywhere else
3. The only `sanitize_input` calls are to `self.sanitizer.sanitize_input()` which is the new PromptSanitizer method

Let me also check if `sanitize_options` is still used:

Perfect! `sanitize_options` is still being used, so I should keep that import. Let me clean up the unused imports:

```python
from app.utils.sanitization import sanitize_options, PromptSanitizer # Enhanced import
```

Perfect! Now let's mark subtask 5.4 as done and move to the final subtask 5.5:

Now let's work on the final subtask 5.5 - updating and running integration tests. Let me first check if there are existing tests for the text processor:

Great! Let me examine the existing tests:

I can see that there are existing tests for the text processor, including some sanitization tests. However, these tests need to be updated to reflect the new implementation using `PromptSanitizer` and `create_safe_prompt`. Let me run the existing tests first to see what fails:

Let me check if pytest is installed and run the tests properly:

Perfect! The tests are failing exactly as expected because they're trying to mock `sanitize_input_advanced` which we removed from the imports. I need to update these tests to work with the new `PromptSanitizer` implementation. Let me update the failing tests:

Now I need to update the failing tests to work with the new implementation. Let me update them:

```python
# Add import for sanitization functions
from app.utils.sanitization import sanitize_options, PromptSanitizer
```

I realize I made an error in the test updates. The tests are trying to mock the wrong functions. Let me fix this properly. The tests should be mocking the `PromptSanitizer.sanitize_input` method, not the old functions. Let me rewrite these tests correctly:

```python
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_process_text_calls_sanitize_input(self, text_processor_service: TextProcessorService):
        request = TextProcessingRequest(
            text="<unsafe> text",
            operation=ProcessingOperation.SUMMARIZE,
            options={"detail": "<unsafe_option>"},
            question="<unsafe_question>"
        )

        # Mock the PromptSanitizer.sanitize_input method
        with patch.object(text_processor_service.sanitizer, 'sanitize_input', side_effect=lambda x: x.replace('<', '').replace('>', '')) as mock_sanitize_input, \
             patch('app.services.text_processor.sanitize_options', side_effect=sanitize_options) as mock_sanitize_options:

            await text_processor_service.process_text(request)

            # Check sanitize_input was called for text and question
            assert mock_sanitize_input.call_count >= 1
            mock_sanitize_input.assert_any_call("<unsafe> text")

            # Check sanitize_options was called for options
            mock_sanitize_options.assert_called_once_with({"detail": "<unsafe_option>"})

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_summarize_text_prompt_structure_and_sanitized_input(self, text_processor_service: TextProcessorService):

Now let's run the tests again to see if our updates fixed the issues:

Excellent! All the sanitization tests are now passing. Let's run the full test suite to make sure we didn't break anything else:

I'll help you execute Task 5, which involves upgrading the `text_processor.py` integration to use the full `PromptSanitizer` and `create_safe_prompt` implementations. Let me start by checking the current state and dependencies.

Let me check the dependencies to ensure they're completed:

Great! Both dependencies (Tasks 2 and 4) are completed. Now let me examine the current state of `text_processor.py` to understand what needs to be updated:

Now let me read the rest of the file to see the actual implementation methods:

Perfect! I can see that the text processor has already been updated to use the new security infrastructure. Let me check what templates are available in the prompt_builder:

Great! I can see that the text processor has already been updated to use the new security infrastructure. Let me check the current status by updating the subtask that's in progress:

Now let me check if there are existing integration tests for the text processor:
