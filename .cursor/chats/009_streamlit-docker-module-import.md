**Cursor**

I can see the issue from the error logs. The Streamlit app is running inside a Docker container where the module path structure is different, causing a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `frontend` module. Let me examine the project structure and fix the import paths.

Now I understand the issue. The Docker container is running the app from `/app` directory, and the imports are trying to reference `frontend.app.utils` which doesn't exist in that context. The app is being run as `app/app.py` from the container's working directory `/app`, so the imports should be relative to that structure.

Let me check the current import structure in the utils directory:

Now I understand the issue completely. The problem is that inside the Docker container, the working directory is `/app` and the file structure is:

```
/app/
  app/
    app.py
    config.py
    utils/
      api_client.py
  shared/
    models.py
```

But the imports in `app.py` and `api_client.py` are trying to import `frontend.app.utils` and `frontend.app.config`, which don't exist in this context. I need to fix the import paths to be relative to the container's working directory.

Let me fix the imports:

```plaintext
/app/
  app/
    app.py
    config.py
    utils/
      api_client.py
  shared/
    models.py
```

```python
from shared.models import TextProcessingRequest, ProcessingOperation
from frontend.app.utils.api_client import api_client, run_async
from frontend.app.config import settings

->

from shared.models import TextProcessingRequest, ProcessingOperation
from app.utils.api_client import api_client, run_async
from app.config import settings
```

```python
from shared.models import (
    TextProcessingRequest, 
    TextProcessingResponse, 
    ProcessingOperation,
    ErrorResponse
)
from frontend.app.config import settings

->

from shared.models import (
    TextProcessingRequest, 
    TextProcessingResponse, 
    ProcessingOperation,
    ErrorResponse
)
from app.config import settings
```

Now let me check if there are any other files that might have similar import issues:

I found some test files that also have the same import issue. Let me fix those as well:

```python
from frontend.app.config import Settings, settings

->

from app.config import Settings, settings
```

```python
from frontend.app.utils.api_client import APIClient

->

from app.utils.api_client import APIClient
```

```python
from frontend.app.utils.api_client import APIClient, run_async

->

from app.utils.api_client import APIClient, run_async
```

Now let me check if there are any other import issues by looking for any remaining `frontend.` imports:

Great! Now let me also check if there are any issues with the shared models import. Let me verify that the shared directory structure is correct:

This looks like there might be some nested shared directories. Let me check the Docker setup to see how the shared models are being made available:

Perfect! I can see that the shared directory is being mounted as `/app/shared` in both containers. This means the import `from shared.models import ...` should work correctly.

Now let me test if the application works by running it. First, let me check if there are any environment variables that need to be set:

Let me check if the application is currently running and test the fix:

Great! The containers are running. Now let me restart the frontend container to apply the import fixes:

Now let me check the logs to see if the import issue has been resolved:

I see the issue now. The problem is that the app is being run from within the `app` directory, so `app` is not a package but rather the current directory. I need to use relative imports instead. Let me check the exact structure in the container:

Now I understand the issue. The app is being run from `/app` directory with the command `streamlit run app/app.py`. This means the working directory is `/app` and the Python path includes `/app`. So when the app tries to import `app.utils`, it's looking for `/app/app/utils` but since the script is running from within the app directory context, it can't find the `app` package.

I need to change the imports to be relative to the `/app` working directory. Let me fix this:

```python
from shared.models import TextProcessingRequest, ProcessingOperation
from app.utils.api_client import api_client, run_async
from app.config import settings

->

from shared.models import TextProcessingRequest, ProcessingOperation
from app.utils.api_client import api_client, run_async
from app.config import settings
```

Wait, that's not right. Let me revert that and think about this differently. The issue is that when Streamlit runs `app/app.py`, the current working directory is `/app`, but the script is in `/app/app/app.py`. I need to use relative imports or adjust the Python path.

Let me check how the Dockerfile is set up again and see if I can modify the command:

```python
from shared.models import TextProcessingRequest, ProcessingOperation
from frontend.app.utils.api_client import api_client, run_async
from frontend.app.config import settings

->

import sys
import os
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))

from shared.models import TextProcessingRequest, ProcessingOperation
from app.utils.api_client import api_client, run_async
from app.config import settings
```

Let me read the current state of the file:

I can see the imports are currently using `from app.utils.api_client import api_client, run_async` and `from app.config import settings`. The issue is that when running from `/app` with `streamlit run app/app.py`, the Python interpreter can't find the `app` module because it's not in the Python path correctly.

Let me try a different approach. I'll modify the imports to use relative imports:

```python
from shared.models import TextProcessingRequest, ProcessingOperation
from app.utils.api_client import api_client, run_async
from app.config import settings

->

from shared.models import TextProcessingRequest, ProcessingOperation
from .utils.api_client import api_client, run_async
from .config import settings
```

Now I need to also fix the import in the api_client.py file:

```python
from shared.models import (
    TextProcessingRequest, 
    TextProcessingResponse, 
    ProcessingOperation,
    ErrorResponse
)
from app.config import settings

->

from shared.models import (
    TextProcessingRequest, 
    TextProcessingResponse, 
    ProcessingOperation,
    ErrorResponse
)
from ..config import settings
```

Now let me restart the frontend container to test the relative imports:

The relative imports don't work either because the script is being run directly, not as part of a package. Let me try a different approach. I'll modify the Dockerfile to change the working directory and the command to run the app properly.

Let me check the current Dockerfile command and modify it:

```dockerfile
# Run the application with hot reload
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app/app.py", "--server.address", "0.0.0.0", "--server.port", "8501", "--server.runOnSave", "true"]

->

# Run the application with hot reload
WORKDIR /app/app
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.address", "0.0.0.0", "--server.port", "8501", "--server.runOnSave", "true"]
```

```dockerfile
# Run the application
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app/app.py", "--server.address", "0.0.0.0", "--server.port", "8501"]

->

# Run the application
WORKDIR /app/app
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.address", "0.0.0.0", "--server.port", "8501"]
```

Wait, that approach won't work either because then the shared directory won't be accessible. Let me revert the Dockerfile changes and try a different approach. I'll modify the Python path in the app itself:

```dockerfile
# Run the application with hot reload
WORKDIR /app/app
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.address", "0.0.0.0", "--server.port", "8501", "--server.runOnSave", "true"]

->

# Run the application with hot reload
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app/app.py", "--server.address", "0.0.0.0", "--server.port", "8501", "--server.runOnSave", "true"]
```

```dockerfile
# Run the application
WORKDIR /app/app
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.address", "0.0.0.0", "--server.port", "8501"]

->

# Run the application
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app/app.py", "--server.address", "0.0.0.0", "--server.port", "8501"]
```

Now let me modify the app.py to add the correct path to sys.path and use absolute imports:

```python
"""Main Streamlit application."""

import streamlit as st
import asyncio
import json
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional

from shared.models import TextProcessingRequest, ProcessingOperation
from .utils.api_client import api_client, run_async
from .config import settings

->

"""Main Streamlit application."""

import sys
import os
# Add the parent directory to Python path so we can import app modules
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))

import streamlit as st
import asyncio
import json
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional

from shared.models import TextProcessingRequest, ProcessingOperation
from app.utils.api_client import api_client, run_async
from app.config import settings
```

Now I need to revert the api_client.py import back to absolute:

```python
from shared.models import (
    TextProcessingRequest, 
    TextProcessingResponse, 
    ProcessingOperation,
    ErrorResponse
)
from ..config import settings

->

from shared.models import (
    TextProcessingRequest, 
    TextProcessingResponse, 
    ProcessingOperation,
    ErrorResponse
)
from app.config import settings
```

Wait, that's not right. Let me fix that:

```python
from app.config import settings

->

from app.config import settings
```

Let me check what happened:

Good, the import is correct now. Let me restart the frontend container to test the fix:

It looks like the container is still running the old version. Let me check if the container is actually using the updated code by rebuilding it:

Excellent! The logs show that the Streamlit app is now running successfully without any import errors. Let me verify that the application is working by checking its health:

Perfect! The health check returns "ok", which means the Streamlit application is running successfully. Let me also check if the backend is accessible from the frontend:

Excellent! The backend is also accessible from the frontend container. Now let me also fix the test files to use the same import pattern for consistency:

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
import os

from app.config import Settings, settings

->

import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
import os
import sys

# Add the parent directory to Python path so we can import app modules
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))

from app.config import Settings, settings
```

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch
import httpx

from app.utils.api_client import APIClient
from shared.models import TextProcessingRequest, TextProcessingResponse, ProcessingOperation

->

import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch
import httpx
import sys
import os

# Add the parent directory to Python path so we can import app modules
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))

from app.utils.api_client import APIClient
from shared.models import TextProcessingRequest, TextProcessingResponse, ProcessingOperation
```

```python
"""Tests for the API client."""

import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch
import httpx

from app.utils.api_client import APIClient, run_async
from shared.models import ProcessingOperation

->

"""Tests for the API client."""

import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch
import httpx
import sys
import os

# Add the parent directory to Python path so we can import app modules
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))

from app.utils.api_client import APIClient, run_async
from shared.models import ProcessingOperation
```

Now let me test if the tests work correctly:

Let me run the tests inside the Docker container instead:

Great! The tests are running successfully. The async tests are being skipped because they need special configuration, but the important thing is that the imports are working correctly now. Let me also verify that the Streamlit app is fully functional by checking if it can access the backend:

The curl test might not work well with Streamlit's dynamic content. Let me check the container status and logs one more time to ensure everything is working:

Perfect! All containers are running and healthy. Let me check the latest logs to confirm there are no errors:

Excellent! The Streamlit application is running successfully without any import errors. Let me create a summary of what was fixed:

## Summary

I successfully resolved the `ModuleNotFoundError` in the Streamlit frontend application. Here's what was causing the issue and how I fixed it:

### **Problem**
The Streamlit app was failing to start with import errors like:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'frontend.app.utils'; 'frontend' is not a package
```

### **Root Cause**
The issue was with the import paths in the Docker container environment. The app was being run from `/app` directory with the command `streamlit run app/app.py`, but the imports were trying to reference `frontend.app.utils` and `frontend.app.config`, which didn't exist in the container's file structure.

### **Solution**
I fixed the import paths by:

1. **Modified `frontend/app/app.py`**:
   - Added Python path manipulation at the top of the file:
   ```python
   import sys
   import os
   # Add the parent directory to Python path so we can import app modules
   sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))
   ```
   - Changed imports from `frontend.app.utils.api_client` to `app.utils.api_client`
   - Changed imports from `frontend.app.config` to `app.config`

2. **Modified `frontend/app/utils/api_client.py`**:
   - Changed import from `frontend.app.config` to `app.config`

3. **Updated test files** to use the same import pattern for consistency:
   - `frontend/tests/test_config.py`
   - `frontend/tests/conftest.py` 
   - `frontend/tests/test_api_client.py`

### **Result**
✅ The Streamlit application now starts successfully  
✅ All containers are healthy and running  
✅ Frontend can communicate with the backend API  
✅ Tests run without import errors  
✅ The app is accessible at `http://localhost:8501`

The application is now fully functional and ready to use for AI text processing tasks!
