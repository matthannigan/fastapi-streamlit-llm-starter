    """
    Collect all available environment detection signals from configured sources.
    
    Gathers environment detection evidence from environment variables,
    system indicators, and hostname patterns. Signals are collected in
    priority order with confidence scoring for later resolution.
    
    Args:
        config: Detection configuration with patterns and precedence settings
        
    Returns:
        List of EnvironmentSignal objects, each containing:
        - source: Detection mechanism (env_var, system_indicator, hostname_pattern)
        - value: Raw value that triggered the detection
        - environment: Environment indicated by this signal
        - confidence: Confidence score for this detection
        - reasoning: Human-readable explanation
    
    Behavior:
        - Checks environment variables in configured precedence order

def detect_from_env_vars(config: DetectionConfig) -> List[EnvironmentSignal]:
    """
    Detect environment from environment variables using configured precedence.
    
    Checks environment variables in priority order, with ENVIRONMENT having
    highest precedence and framework-specific variables (NODE_ENV, FLASK_ENV)
    having lower precedence. Provides direct string-to-environment mapping.
    
    Args:
        config: Detection configuration with env_var_precedence settings
        
    Returns:
        List of EnvironmentSignal objects from environment variable detection.
        Signals are ordered by precedence with highest confidence for
        ENVIRONMENT variable and decreasing confidence for others.
    
    Behavior:
        - Iterates through env_var_precedence list in order
        - Maps common environment values (dev, prod, test, staging) to Environment enums
        - Assigns confidence scores based on variable precedence
        - Skips empty or undefined environment variables

def detect_from_system_indicators(config: DetectionConfig) -> List[EnvironmentSignal]:
    """
    Detect environment from system indicators and file presence.
    
    Examines system-level indicators like DEBUG flags, file presence
    (e.g., .env, .git, docker-compose files), and production indicators
    to infer the current environment context.
    
    Args:
        config: Detection configuration with indicator settings
        
    Returns:
        List of EnvironmentSignal objects from system indicator detection.
        Each signal represents one system indicator with appropriate
        confidence scoring based on indicator reliability.
    
    Behavior:
        - Checks development indicators (DEBUG=true, .env files, .git directories)
        - Checks production indicators (DEBUG=false, PRODUCTION=true)
        - Validates file existence for file-based indicators
        - Validates environment variable values for variable-based indicators
        - Assigns moderate confidence scores (0.70-0.75) as these are indirect signals
        - Returns empty list if no system indicators are found
    
    Examples:
        >>> config = DetectionConfig()

def check_indicator(indicator: str) -> bool:

    Check if a system indicator is present in the environment.
    
    Validates both environment variable indicators (KEY=value format)
    and file-based indicators (file paths) to determine if the
    specified system condition exists.
    
    Args:
        indicator: System indicator to check. Format depends on type:
                  - Environment variable: "VAR_NAME=expected_value"
                  - File existence: "path/to/file" or "filename"
    
    Returns:
        True if the indicator condition is met, False otherwise.
        For environment variables: True if variable equals expected value
        For files: True if file exists at the specified path
    
    Behavior:
        - Detects indicator type by presence of '=' character
        - For env vars: performs case-insensitive value comparison
        - For files: checks file existence using Path.exists()
        - Returns False for malformed indicators or missing conditions
        - Does not raise exceptions for invalid paths or variables

def detect_from_patterns(config: DetectionConfig) -> List[EnvironmentSignal]:
    """
    Detect environment from hostname and URL patterns.
    
    Applies regex pattern matching to hostname and URL values to identify
    environment context. Particularly useful in containerized deployments
    where hostname or service names follow naming conventions.
    
    Args:
        config: Detection configuration with pattern settings
        
    Returns:
        List of EnvironmentSignal objects from pattern matching.
        Signals include the matched hostname/URL and the pattern that
        identified the environment context.
    
    Behavior:
        - Retrieves hostname from HOSTNAME environment variable
        - Applies regex patterns for development, staging, and production
        - Uses case-insensitive matching for broader compatibility
        - Stops at first match per pattern category for efficiency
        - Assigns moderate confidence (0.60-0.70) as patterns can be ambiguous
        - Returns empty list if no HOSTNAME set or no patterns match
        - Logs warnings for invalid regex patterns but continues with valid patterns
