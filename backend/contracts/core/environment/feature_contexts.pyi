def apply_feature_context(signals: List[EnvironmentSignal], context: FeatureContext, config: DetectionConfig) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Apply feature-specific context and overrides to detection signals.
    
    Processes feature-specific environment variables and configuration
    to modify detection behavior. May add additional signals or metadata
    based on feature requirements like AI enabling or security enforcement.
    
    Args:
        signals: Base environment signals from standard detection
        context: Feature context specifying specialized detection logic
        config: Detection configuration with feature context settings
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing:
        - 'signals': Original signals list (unmodified)
        - 'additional_signals': Feature-specific signals to add
        - 'metadata': Feature-specific metadata and configuration hints
    
    Behavior:
        - Returns original signals unchanged for DEFAULT context
        - Checks feature-specific environment variables when configured
        - Adds metadata hints for cache prefixes, security overrides, etc.
        - May inject additional signals for feature-specific overrides
        - Preserves original signal list while adding context-specific data
        - Logs feature-specific detection decisions
    
    Examples:
        >>> config = DetectionConfig()
        >>> base_signals = [EnvironmentSignal(...)]  # from standard detection
        >>>
        >>> # AI context adds cache prefix metadata

def determine_environment(signals: List[EnvironmentSignal]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Determine final environment from all collected signals using confidence scoring.
    
    Analyzes all environment signals to make a final environment determination.
    Uses confidence scoring, conflict resolution, and fallback logic to
    ensure reliable environment detection even with contradictory signals.
    
    Args:
        signals: All environment signals collected from detection sources
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing final environment determination:
        - 'environment': Final Environment enum value
        - 'confidence': Combined confidence score (0.0-1.0)
        - 'reasoning': Human-readable explanation of decision
        - 'detected_by': Primary signal source that determined environment
    
    Behavior:
        - Returns development fallback if no signals provided
        - Sorts signals by confidence score (highest first)
        - Uses highest confidence signal as primary determination
        - Boosts confidence when multiple signals agree
        - Reduces confidence when high-confidence conflicts exist
        - Generates comprehensive reasoning including conflicts
        - Caps combined confidence at 0.98 to indicate uncertainty
    
    Examples:
        >>> # Multiple agreeing signals boost confidence
        >>> signals = [
        ...     EnvironmentSignal(..., environment=Environment.PRODUCTION, confidence=0.85),
        ...     EnvironmentSignal(..., environment=Environment.PRODUCTION, confidence=0.70)
