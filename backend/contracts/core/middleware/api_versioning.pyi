"""
API Versioning Middleware

## Overview

Robust API version detection and routing with support for URL prefix, headers,
query parameters, and Accept media types. Adds response headers with current
and supported versions, and can perform compatibility transformations.

Now includes a safe-by-default exemption for internal routes mounted at `/internal/*`
so that administrative endpoints are not rewritten with public API version prefixes.

## Detection Strategies

- **Path**: `/v1/`, `/v2/`, `/v1.5/`
- **Headers**: `X-API-Version`, `API-Version`, or custom via settings
- **Query**: `?version=1.0` or `?api_version=1.0`
- **Accept**: `application/vnd.api+json;version=2.0`

## Behavior

- Writes detected version and method to `request.state`
- Rejects unsupported versions with a stable JSON payload and
  `X-API-Supported-Versions`/`X-API-Current-Version` headers
- Optionally rewrites paths to the expected version prefix
- Skips versioning for health-check paths (e.g., `/health`, `/readiness`)
- Skips versioning for internal API paths (e.g., `/internal/resilience/health`) to
  prevent unintended rewrites like `/v1/internal/resilience/health`

## Configuration

Configured via `app.core.config.Settings` and helper settings in this module:

- `api_versioning_enabled`, `default_api_version`, `current_api_version`
- `min_api_version`, `max_api_version`, `api_supported_versions`
- `api_version_compatibility_enabled`, `api_version_header`
- `api_versioning_skip_internal` (bool, default: True)
  - When True, requests whose path is `/internal` or starts with `/internal/`
    bypass version detection and path rewriting

## Examples

```text
Request:  GET /internal/resilience/health
Before:   (could be rewritten to /v1/internal/resilience/health)
After:    Versioning bypassed; remains /internal/resilience/health
```

## Usage

```python
from app.core.middleware.api_versioning import APIVersioningMiddleware
from app.core.config import settings

app.add_middleware(APIVersioningMiddleware, settings=settings)
```

class APIVersioningMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    """
    Production-grade API versioning middleware with multiple detection strategies and comprehensive compatibility handling.
    
    Provides robust API version detection and routing with support for URL prefixes, headers,
    query parameters, and Accept media types. Ensures backward compatibility through intelligent
    version matching and handles deprecation scenarios with appropriate headers and warnings.
    
    Attributes:
        enabled (bool): Whether the middleware is active for processing requests
        skip_internal_paths (bool): Whether to bypass versioning for internal API routes
        default_version (str): Default version used when no version is detected
        current_version (str): The latest/current API version
        min_api_version (str): Minimum supported API version
        max_api_version (str): Maximum supported API version
        version_header (str): Header name used for version responses
        supported_versions_list (List[str]): List of all supported API versions
        supported_versions (Dict[str, Dict]): Detailed version information with status and metadata
    
    Public Methods:
        dispatch(): Main middleware entry point for request processing
        _normalize_version(): Converts version strings to standard format
        _detect_api_version(): Extracts version using multiple strategies
        _is_version_supported(): Validates if a version is supported
    
    State Management:
        - Version detection uses configurable strategy hierarchy (path â†’ header â†’ query â†’ default)
        - Request state is populated with detected version information for downstream use
        - Version compatibility is maintained through intelligent version matching
        - Thread-safe through request-scoped state management
    
    Usage:
        # Basic setup with default settings
        from app.core.middleware.api_versioning import APIVersioningMiddleware
        from app.core.config import settings
    
        app.add_middleware(APIVersioningMiddleware, settings=settings)
    
        # Requests now support multiple versioning strategies:
        # Path: GET /v1/users
        # Header: GET /users with "X-API-Version: 1.0"
        # Query: GET /users?version=1.0
        # Accept: GET /users with "Accept: application/vnd.api+json;version=1.0"
    
        # Access version information in endpoints
        @app.get("/users")
        async def get_users(request: Request):
            api_version = getattr(request.state, 'api_version', '1.0')
            detection_method = getattr(request.state, 'api_version_detection_method', 'default')
            return {"version": api_version, "method": detection_method}
    
    Version Detection Strategy:
        The middleware applies strategies in order of precedence:
        1. Path-based extraction from URL patterns like /v1/, /v2/, /v1.5/
        2. Header-based extraction from X-API-Version, API-Version, or custom headers
        3. Query parameter extraction from ?version=1.0 or ?api_version=1.0
        4. Accept header media type versioning
        5. Default version fallback
    
    Internal API Bypass:
        Internal routes mounted at /internal/* automatically bypass versioning
        to prevent unintended path rewrites like /v1/internal/resilience/health.
        This behavior is configurable via the api_versioning_skip_internal setting.
    
    Note:
        The middleware adds comprehensive version headers to responses including
        X-API-Version, X-API-Supported-Versions, X-API-Current-Version, and
        deprecation headers when applicable. Health check and documentation
        endpoints also bypass versioning for accessibility.
