- **GET /internal/security/cache/stats**: Get cache statistics and health
- **DELETE /internal/security/cache**: Clear all cached security results
- **GET /internal/security/cache/health**: Get cache health status
- **POST /internal/security/cache/warmup**: Warm up cache with common patterns (future)

    Behavior:
        **Cache Statistics Collection:**
        - Collects real-time statistics from both Redis and memory cache backends
        - Calculates hit/miss rates and performance metrics automatically
        - Aggregates data across all scanner types and cache operations

        **Health and Availability Monitoring:**
        - Checks Redis backend connectivity and responsiveness
        - Validates memory cache functionality and data integrity

    """
    Clear all cached security scan results from all cache backends.
    
    This endpoint performs a complete cache invalidation by removing all cached
    security scan results from both Redis and memory cache backends. This operation
    is useful when updating scanner configurations, deploying new models, or
    troubleshooting cache-related issues. The operation is irreversible and will
    force subsequent security scans to be performed without cache benefits.

                      troubleshooting and remediation.
    
    Behavior:
        **Complete Cache Invalidation:**
        - Removes all cached security scan results from all active backends
        - Clears both Redis cache (if configured) and in-memory cache
        - Invalidates cache entries for all scanner types and content categories
        - Resets cache statistics and performance counters to initial state
    
        **Backend Management:**
        - Attempts to clear all configured cache backends independently
        - Continues operation even if some backends are unavailable
        - Logs success/failure status for each backend separately
        - Provides detailed error reporting for failed backend operations
    
        **Impact and Consequences:**
        - Forces all subsequent security scans to execute without cache hits
        - Temporarily increases security scan processing time and resource usage
        - May impact application performance until cache is repopulated
        - Does not affect active security scans or in-flight operations
    
        **Safety and Recovery:**
        - Operation is atomic within each backend (complete success or failure)
        - Maintains service availability during cache clearing process
        - Automatic cache repopulation occurs with subsequent security scans
        - No data loss beyond cached results (which are recomputable)
    
    Examples:
        >>> # Complete cache clearing operation
        >>> response = await clear_security_cache(security_service)
        >>> assert response["status"] == "success"
        >>> assert "cleared successfully" in response["message"].lower()

        >>> # After updating scanner thresholds or models:
        >>> response = await clear_security_cache(security_service)
        >>> assert response["status"] == "success"
        >>> # Subsequent scans will use new configuration without cached results
    
        >>> # Error handling scenario
        >>> # If Redis connection fails during clearing:
        >>> # HTTPException: 500 - "Failed to clear cache: Redis connection timeout"
        >>> # But memory cache might still be cleared successfully
    
        >>> # Monitoring cache clearing impact
        >>> # After cache clearing, monitor performance metrics:
        >>> stats_before = await get_cache_statistics(security_service)
        >>> await clear_security_cache(security_service)
        >>> # Subsequent scans will repopulate cache over time
    
    Note:
        This is a destructive operation that cannot be undone. Use it carefully
        in production environments as it will temporarily degrade security scanning
        performance until the cache is repopulated. Consider the impact on system
        load and response times before executing this operation during peak usage.
    
        Cache clearing does not affect security scanner configurations or models
        directly - it only removes cached results. New configurations remain active
        and will be applied to subsequent security scans.

                - uptime_seconds: int - Service uptime duration

    Raises:
        HTTPException: 500 error when performance metrics cannot be retrieved
                      due to service unavailability, monitoring system failures,
                      or data collection issues.
    
    Behavior:
        **Comprehensive Metrics Collection:**
        - Aggregates performance data from all security scanning operations
        - Collects cache-specific metrics across all active backends
        - Measures system resource usage and efficiency indicators
        - Provides historical performance trends and anomaly detection
    
        **Performance Analysis:**
        - Calculates hit/miss rates and cache efficiency metrics
        - Measures response times and latency distribution
        - Tracks throughput and processing capacity utilization
        - Monitors resource consumption and optimization opportunities
    
        **System Health Monitoring:**
        - Tracks service availability and reliability metrics
        - Monitors error rates and failure patterns
        - Measures system performance under varying load conditions
        - Provides early warning indicators for performance degradation
    
    Examples:
        >>> # Basic performance metrics request
        >>> response = await get_cache_performance(security_service)
        >>> data = response["data"]
        >>> assert "security_service_metrics" in data
        >>> assert "cache_metrics" in data
    
        >>> # Service metrics analysis
        >>> response = await get_cache_performance(security_service)
        >>> service_metrics = response["data"]["security_service_metrics"]
        >>> assert "input_metrics" in service_metrics
        >>> assert service_metrics["uptime_seconds"] > 0
    
        >>> # Performance monitoring integration
        >>> def check_performance_health(response):
        ...     cache_metrics = response["data"]["cache_metrics"]
        ...     hit_rate = cache_metrics.get("hit_rate", 0)
        ...     return hit_rate > 50  # Expect at least 50% hit rate
        >>>
        >>> perf_response = await get_cache_performance(security_service)
        >>> if check_performance_health(perf_response):
        ...     logger.info("Cache performance is healthy")
    
    Note:
        Performance metrics are collected in real-time and may vary based on
        current system load and usage patterns. Use these metrics for trend
        analysis and capacity planning rather than absolute performance
        guarantees.
