Infrastructure Service: Resilience Performance Benchmarking API

🏗️ **STABLE API** - Changes affect all template users  
📋 **Minimum test coverage**: 90%  
🔧 **Configuration-driven behavior**

This module provides comprehensive REST API endpoints for performance
benchmarking, threshold management, and performance analysis of resilience
configurations and operations. It includes capabilities for running custom
benchmarks, analyzing historical performance data, and generating detailed
performance reports with recommendations.

The module implements sophisticated performance measurement and analysis
tools that help optimize resilience configurations for maximum efficiency
and reliability. All endpoints provide detailed performance insights with
actionable recommendations for system optimization.

Endpoints:
    GET  /resilience/performance/benchmark: Run comprehensive performance benchmark suite
    POST /internal/resilience/performance/benchmark: Run custom performance benchmarks with specific parameters
    GET  /resilience/performance/thresholds: Get performance thresholds and targets (optional auth)
    GET  /resilience/performance/report: Generate detailed performance analysis report
    GET  /resilience/performance/history: Retrieve historical performance data and trends

Performance Benchmarking Features:
    - Comprehensive benchmark suite with multiple test scenarios
    - Custom benchmark configuration with specific operations and iterations
    - Performance threshold validation and compliance checking
    - Historical performance tracking and trend analysis
    - Detailed performance reporting with optimization recommendations

Benchmark Operations:
    - Preset loading performance measurement
    - Settings initialization timing analysis
    - Resilience configuration loading benchmarks
    - Service initialization performance testing
    - Custom configuration loading efficiency analysis
    - Legacy configuration compatibility performance
    - Validation performance optimization testing

Performance Metrics:
    - Average, minimum, and maximum execution times
    - Standard deviation analysis for consistency measurement
    - Memory usage tracking and peak memory consumption
    - Success rate monitoring and failure analysis
    - Throughput measurement and capacity planning
    - Performance target compliance and threshold validation

Benchmark Customization:
    - Configurable iteration counts for statistical accuracy
    - Selective operation benchmarking for focused analysis
    - Custom performance thresholds and target setting
    - Memory tracking with peak usage analysis
    - Statistical analysis with standard deviation calculation

Dependencies:
    - PerformanceBenchmark: Core benchmarking engine with multiple test scenarios
    - PerformanceThreshold: Configurable performance targets and limits
    - BenchmarkSuite: Comprehensive benchmark orchestration and results aggregation
    - Security: API key verification for most endpoints (thresholds endpoint has optional auth)

Authentication:
    Most endpoints require API key authentication for secure access to
    performance data. The thresholds endpoint supports optional authentication
    for monitoring system compatibility.

Example:
    Run comprehensive benchmark suite:
        GET /internal/resilience/performance/benchmark?iterations=100
        
    Run custom benchmarks for specific operations:
        POST /internal/resilience/performance/benchmark
        {
            "iterations": 50,
            "operations": ["preset_loading", "validation_performance"],
            "include_slow": false
        }
        
    Get performance thresholds:
        GET /internal/resilience/performance/thresholds

Note:
    Performance benchmarks provide valuable insights for optimization but
    may cause temporary CPU and memory spikes during execution. Historical
    data helps identify performance trends and regression issues over time.
