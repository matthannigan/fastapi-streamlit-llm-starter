ðŸ”„ **Expected to be modified/replaced**

This module provides a comprehensive REST API implementation for AI-powered text processing operations,
serving as a complete reference implementation that demonstrates enterprise-grade patterns for building
domain services with robust infrastructure integration. It showcases how to leverage infrastructure
services for AI processing, caching, resilience patterns, security, and operational monitoring while
maintaining clean separation of concerns between domain logic and infrastructure capabilities.

The module implements production-ready patterns including authentication, validation, caching, resilience,
monitoring, and error handling, providing a complete template for AI-powered API development that can be
customized and extended for specific business requirements while maintaining operational excellence.

## Architecture Overview

### Domain Service Implementation Pattern
This module demonstrates the **Domain Service** architectural pattern where business logic is implemented
as services that orchestrate infrastructure capabilities. The text processing operations represent domain
functionality that leverages infrastructure services for:

- **AI Model Integration**: PydanticAI agents with Gemini models for text processing operations
- **Caching Layer**: Redis-backed response caching with memory fallback for performance optimization
- **Resilience Patterns**: Circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, and graceful degradation
- **Security Integration**: API key authentication and input validation for secure operation
- **Monitoring Capabilities**: Request tracing, performance metrics, and operational visibility

### API Design Principles
- **RESTful Design**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes with clear resource organization
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Pydantic models for request/response validation and API documentation
- **Error Handling**: Structured exception handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Authentication**: API key-based security with flexible access control patterns
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger integration with comprehensive endpoint documentation

## Core Components

### API Endpoints
- `GET /v1/text_processing/operations`: Available operations and configurations (optional auth)
- `POST /v1/text_processing/process`: Single text processing with AI operations (requires auth)
- `POST /v1/text_processing/batch_process`: Batch text processing with limits (requires auth)
- `GET /v1/text_processing/batch_status/{batch_id}`: Batch status checking (requires auth)
- `GET /v1/text_processing/health`: Service health with infrastructure status (optional auth)

### Processing Operations
- **summarize**: Text summarization with configurable length
- **sentiment**: Sentiment analysis with confidence scores  
- **key_points**: Key point extraction with configurable count
- **questions**: Question generation from text content
- **qa**: Question answering (requires question parameter)

### Features
- **Batch Processing**: Configurable limits with comprehensive error handling
- **Request Tracing**: Unique IDs for logging and debugging
- **Resilience Integration**: Circuit breakers, retries, and graceful degradation
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic models with sanitization
- **Error Handling**: Structured exceptions with proper HTTP status codes

## Dependencies & Integration

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- `app.infrastructure.security`: API key authentication services
- `app.services.text_processor.TextProcessorService`: AI text processing with resilience
- `app.core.exceptions`: Structured exception handling
- `app.schemas`: Pydantic request/response models

### Domain Logic
- Operation validation and business rule enforcement
- Batch size limits and concurrent processing management
- Request tracing and logging for operational visibility
- Health monitoring that combines domain and infrastructure status

## Usage Examples

### Single Text Processing
```bash
POST /v1/text_processing/process
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer your-api-key

{
    "text": "Your text to process here",
    "operation": "summarize", 
    "options": {"max_length": 150}
}
```

### Batch Processing
```bash
POST /v1/text_processing/batch_process
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer your-api-key

{
    "requests": [
        {"text": "First document", "operation": "sentiment"},
        {"text": "Second document", "operation": "key_points", "options": {"max_points": 5}}
    ],
    "batch_id": "my-batch-2024"
}
```

### Operations Discovery
```bash
GET /v1/text_processing/operations
# No auth required - returns available operations and their options
```

## Response Examples

### Successful Processing
```json
{
    "result": "Generated summary of the input text...",
    "operation": "summarize",
    "metadata": {"processing_time": 1.23}
}
```

### Batch Response
```json
{
    "batch_id": "my-batch-2024",
    "total_requests": 2,
    "completed": 2,
    "failed": 0,
    "results": [
        {"result": "Positive sentiment", "operation": "sentiment"},
        {"result": "Key points: 1. Point one...", "operation": "key_points"}
    ]
}
```

## Error Handling

### Exception Types
- `ValidationError`: Invalid requests, missing required fields
- `BusinessLogicError`: Domain rule violations, operation constraints
- `InfrastructureError`: AI service failures, cache issues, network problems

### HTTP Status Codes
- `200 OK`: Successful processing
- `400 Bad Request`: Validation errors
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication failures
- `422 Unprocessable Entity`: Request validation errors
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Infrastructure failures
- `502 Bad Gateway`: AI service errors
- `503 Service Unavailable`: Service temporarily unavailable

## Implementation Notes

This service demonstrates domain-level text processing APIs that:
- Compose multiple infrastructure services for comprehensive functionality
- Implement proper authentication and authorization patterns
- Provide structured error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Support both single and batch processing with configurable limits
- Include comprehensive logging and request tracing for operations

**Replace in your project** - This is a complete example of an AI-powered domain service.
Customize the operations, validation logic, and business rules based on your specific
text processing requirements and use cases.

    Get the status of a batch processing job.
    
    Returns the current status of a batch processing operation. Note that the current
    implementation processes batches synchronously, so this endpoint primarily serves
    as a status confirmation for completed batches.
    
    Args:
        batch_id (str): The unique identifier of the batch to check status for.
        api_key (str): Valid API key for authentication.
    
    Returns:
        dict: Batch status information containing:
            - batch_id (str): The requested batch identifier
            - status (str): Current status of the batch (typically "COMPLETED_SYNC")
            - message (str): Descriptive message about the batch status
    
    Note:
        This is a placeholder endpoint for the current synchronous implementation.
        In future versions with asynchronous batch processing, this will provide
        real-time status updates including progress percentages and partial results.
