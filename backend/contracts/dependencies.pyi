FastAPI Dependency Injection Providers - Centralized Service Integration and Configuration Management

This module serves as the core dependency injection orchestration layer for the FastAPI application,
implementing comprehensive dependency management patterns that enable scalable, testable, and maintainable
service integration. It provides the critical bridge between FastAPI's dependency injection system and
the application's infrastructure services, ensuring proper service lifecycle management, configuration
consistency, and graceful error handling across all application components.

## Architecture Overview

### Dependency Injection Strategy
The module implements a layered dependency injection strategy following enterprise-grade patterns:

**1. Configuration Layer**: Singleton and fresh configuration providers with caching optimization
**2. Service Layer**: Async service initialization with graceful degradation and error resilience  
**3. Monitoring Layer**: Health check infrastructure with comprehensive system validation
**4. Integration Layer**: Seamless integration between FastAPI endpoints and infrastructure services

### Core Design Principles
- **Singleton Pattern**: Critical services use LRU caching for optimal performance and consistency
- **Graceful Degradation**: Services continue operation even when external dependencies fail
- **Testing Flexibility**: Alternative providers enable isolated testing with configuration overrides
- **Async-First Design**: All service initialization uses async patterns for optimal performance
- **Configuration Consistency**: Centralized configuration management with validation and type safety

## Service Dependencies Architecture

### Configuration Management Services

## Advanced Integration Patterns

### Dependency Chain Architecture
The module supports sophisticated dependency chain patterns enabling complex service integration:

```python
# Multi-level dependency injection with automatic resolution
async def get_ai_text_processor(
    settings: Settings = Depends(get_settings),
    cache: AIResponseCache = Depends(get_cache_service),
    health_checker: HealthChecker = Depends(get_health_checker)
) -> TextProcessor:
    return TextProcessor(
        api_key=settings.gemini_api_key,
        cache_service=cache,
        health_monitor=health_checker
    )
```

### Configuration-Driven Service Initialization
All service dependencies automatically integrate with comprehensive configuration management:

**Cache Service Configuration Integration:**
- `redis_url`: Redis backend connectivity with fallback management
- `cache_default_ttl`: Response expiration with performance optimization
- `cache_compression_threshold`: Intelligent compression for large responses
- `cache_text_size_tiers`: Adaptive caching strategies based on content size
- `cache_memory_cache_size`: Memory management for optimal performance

**Health Check Configuration Integration:**
- `health_check_timeout_ms`: Component validation timeout configuration
- `health_check_retry_count`: Retry policies for reliable health assessment
- Per-component timeout configuration for specialized health validation

### Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

#### Service Resilience Strategy
**Comprehensive error handling** ensuring service availability under all operational conditions:

1. **Connection Resilience**: Redis connection failures handled gracefully with memory fallback
2. **Configuration Validation**: Settings validation with meaningful error messages and fallbacks
3. **Service Degradation**: Partial service operation when external dependencies are unavailable
4. **Health Check Robustness**: Health monitoring continues operation with missing components

#### Logging and Observability Integration
**Structured logging** with comprehensive operational visibility:
- **Warning Level**: Service degradation events (Redis unavailability, configuration issues)
- **Info Level**: Service initialization success and health check registration status
- **Error Level**: Critical configuration failures and service initialization problems
- **Debug Level**: Detailed dependency resolution and configuration application details

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Caching and Memory Management
**Optimized caching strategies** for maximum application performance:

- **Settings Caching**: LRU cache eliminates environment variable re-parsing overhead
- **Service Singleton Pattern**: Shared service instances reduce memory footprint and initialization overhead
- **Async Initialization**: Non-blocking service setup for optimal request processing performance
- **Connection Pooling**: Redis connection management through aioreids for optimal network performance

### Concurrent Access Optimization
**Thread-safe concurrent operation** designed for high-traffic production environments:

- **Singleton Thread Safety**: All cached dependencies safe for concurrent FastAPI request handling
- **Async Service Management**: Non-blocking service initialization and health check execution
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper service lifecycle management with cleanup on application shutdown

## Testing and Development Integration

### Testing Dependency Override Patterns
**Flexible testing integration** with comprehensive override capabilities:

```python
# Production vs Testing dependency patterns
def configure_test_dependencies(app: FastAPI):
    # Override production dependencies with test alternatives
    app.dependency_overrides[get_settings] = get_fresh_settings
    
    # Custom test service configurations
    def get_test_cache():
        return MockCacheService()
    
    app.dependency_overrides[get_cache_service] = get_test_cache
```

### Development Environment Support
**Development-friendly features** for optimal developer experience:
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Fresh settings provider for configuration experimentation
- **Service Mocking**: Easy service replacement for development and testing scenarios
- **Error Visibility**: Comprehensive error messages for debugging and development
- **Hot Reload Compatibility**: Service dependencies compatible with FastAPI auto-reload

## Production Deployment Considerations

### Security and Configuration Management
**Production-ready security patterns** with comprehensive configuration validation:
- **Environment Variable Security**: No hardcoded secrets or sensitive configuration values
- **Configuration Validation**: Comprehensive settings validation with meaningful error messages
- **Service Authentication**: Secure service-to-service communication patterns
- **Health Check Security**: Health monitoring without exposing sensitive operational details

### Operational Monitoring Integration

        - Configures backoff strategy for failed health check retries
        
        **Component Health Validation:**
        - **AI Model Health**: Validates AI service connectivity and model availability
        - **Cache Health**: Monitors cache infrastructure status and connectivity
        - **Resilience Health**: Checks circuit breaker states and resilience system status
        - Provides aggregated health status across all registered components
        - Enables individual component health status retrieval

    Note:
        This dependency provider uses hardcoded configuration values which limits its
        flexibility and integration with the application settings system. Future versions
        should integrate proper dependency injection for Settings and cache services to
        enable configurable timeouts, retry policies, and component-specific health
        validation parameters. The current implementation provides reliable health
        monitoring with conservative defaults suitable for most deployment scenarios.

    """
    Application startup health monitoring infrastructure initialization with comprehensive validation.
    
    This function performs essential health monitoring system initialization during application startup,
    ensuring that all required health checks are properly registered and the health monitoring infrastructure
    is ready for operation. It implements a fast-boot strategy that validates health check registration
    without executing potentially slow external health validation calls that could delay application startup.
    
    Behavior:
        **Health Checker Initialization:**
        - Triggers creation of the singleton HealthChecker instance through `get_health_checker()`
        - Ensures all standard health checks are properly registered during startup
        - Validates health monitoring infrastructure is ready for incoming requests
        - Prepares centralized health status reporting capabilities
        
        **Required Health Check Validation:**
        - Validates presence of AI model health check registration
        - Confirms cache infrastructure health monitoring is properly configured
        - Ensures resilience system health validation is available
        - Provides comprehensive logging of missing health check components
        
        **Fast-Boot Strategy:**
        - Avoids executing actual health checks that could delay application startup
        - Focuses on infrastructure validation rather than external service calls
        - Maintains quick application boot times while ensuring monitoring readiness
        - Defers actual health validation to runtime when health endpoints are called
        
        **Error Handling and Resilience:**
        - Logs missing health checks as errors without blocking application startup
        - Continues application initialization even when some health checks are missing
        - Provides detailed error messages for operational troubleshooting
        - Maintains graceful degradation approach for health monitoring failures
        
        **Operational Integration:**
        - Prepares health monitoring for production deployment scenarios
        - Enables health check endpoints to function properly from first request
        - Provides startup-time validation of health monitoring configuration
        - Facilitates early detection of health monitoring configuration issues
    
    Examples:
        >>> # Application startup integration (typically in main.py)
        >>> from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
        >>> from fastapi import FastAPI
        >>> from app.dependencies import initialize_health_infrastructure
        >>> 
        >>> @asynccontextmanager
        >>> async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):

        ...     await initialize_health_infrastructure()
        ...     yield
        ...     # Shutdown: Cleanup if needed
        >>> 
        >>> app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
        
        >>> # Manual initialization for testing
        >>> import asyncio
        >>> 
        >>> async def setup_test_environment():
        ...     await initialize_health_infrastructure()
        ...     # Health infrastructure is now ready for testing
        
        >>> # Startup validation logging example
        >>> # INFO: Health checker initialized with standard checks: ai_model, cache, resilience
        >>> # or
        >>> # ERROR: Health checker missing required checks: ['ai_model']
        
        >>> # Health check availability verification after initialization
        >>> from app.dependencies import get_health_checker
        >>> 
        >>> async def verify_health_infrastructure():
        ...     await initialize_health_infrastructure()
        ...     checker = get_health_checker()
        ...     
        ...     # All required checks should be available
        ...     assert "ai_model" in checker._checks
        ...     assert "cache" in checker._checks
        ...     assert "resilience" in checker._checks
    
    Note:
        This function is designed to be called during FastAPI application startup through
        the lifespan context manager. It focuses on infrastructure validation rather than
        actual health check execution to maintain fast application boot times. The actual
        health validation occurs when health endpoints are called during runtime, ensuring
        optimal startup performance while maintaining comprehensive health monitoring capabilities.
