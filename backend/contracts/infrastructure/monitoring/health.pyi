    Check cache system health and operational status using dependency injection for optimal performance.

    This function provides efficient cache health monitoring by accepting an optional cache service
    parameter for dependency injection. When a cache service is provided, it reuses existing
    connections and avoids redundant instantiation, making it ideal for frequent health checks.
    For backward compatibility, it falls back to creating a new cache service when none is provided.

    Args:
        cache_service: Optional AIResponseCache instance for optimal performance.
                      When provided, reuses existing connections and avoids instantiation overhead.
                      If None, creates a new cache service for backward compatibility.

    Returns:
        ComponentStatus with cache connectivity and operational status

    Performance Notes:
        - ✅ OPTIMAL: When cache_service is provided, no instantiation overhead
        - ⚠️ FALLBACK: When cache_service is None, creates new service instance (less efficient)
        - For best performance, use dependency injection in get_health_checker()
