Health Check Infrastructure Module

Comprehensive async-first health monitoring infrastructure providing standardized health
checking capabilities for all system components including AI services, cache infrastructure,
resilience systems, and databases. Implements configurable timeout policies, retry mechanisms,
and graceful degradation patterns for reliable operational monitoring.

## Core Components

### Health Status Management
- **HealthStatus**: Standardized enumeration for HEALTHY, DEGRADED, UNHEALTHY states
- **ComponentStatus**: Individual component health information with timing and metadata
- **SystemHealthStatus**: Aggregated system-wide health status across all components

### Health Check Orchestration
- **HealthChecker**: Centralized health monitoring service with configurable policies
- **HealthCheckFunc**: Type alias for async health check function signatures
- **HealthCheckError**: Base exception hierarchy for health check infrastructure failures

### Built-in Health Checks
- **check_ai_model_health()**: AI service configuration and availability validation
- **check_cache_health()**: Cache infrastructure connectivity and operational status
- **check_resilience_health()**: Resilience system circuit breaker states and stability
- **check_database_health()**: Database connectivity validation (placeholder implementation)

## Architecture Design

### Async-First Performance
All health check operations use async/await patterns for non-blocking execution with
concurrent health monitoring across multiple components. Implements asyncio timeout
protection and parallel execution for optimal performance under load.

### Configurable Policies
- **Timeout Management**: Per-component timeout configuration with fallback defaults
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Configurable retry attempts with exponential backoff patterns
- **Error Classification**: Distinction between timeout errors (DEGRADED) and failures (UNHEALTHY)

### Operational Integration
- **Response Time Tracking**: Microsecond-precision timing for performance monitoring
- **Metadata Collection**: Component-specific diagnostic information for troubleshooting
- **Logging Integration**: Structured logging for health check failures and timeouts

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Health Monitoring
```python
from app.infrastructure.monitoring.health import HealthChecker

# Initialize health checker with configuration
checker = HealthChecker(
    default_timeout_ms=2000,
    retry_count=1,
    backoff_base_seconds=0.1
)

# Register component health checks
checker.register_check("database", check_database_health)
checker.register_check("cache", check_cache_health)
checker.register_check("ai_model", check_ai_model_health)

# Execute individual component health check
status = await checker.check_component("database")
print(f"Database: {status.status.value} - {status.message}")

# Execute comprehensive system health check
system_health = await checker.check_all_components()
if system_health.overall_status == HealthStatus.HEALTHY:
    print("All systems operational")
```

### Advanced Configuration
```python
# Per-component timeout configuration
checker = HealthChecker(
    default_timeout_ms=2000,
    per_component_timeouts_ms={
        "database": 5000,      # Longer timeout for database operations
        "cache": 1000,         # Shorter timeout for cache operations
        "ai_model": 3000       # Medium timeout for AI services
    },
    retry_count=2,
    backoff_base_seconds=0.5
)

# Performance monitoring integration
for component in system_health.components:
    if component.response_time_ms > 1000:
        logger.warning(f"Slow health check: {component.name} ({component.response_time_ms:.1f}ms)")
```

### FastAPI Integration
```python
from fastapi import Depends
from app.dependencies import get_health_checker

@app.get("/health")
async def system_health(checker: HealthChecker = Depends(get_health_checker)):
    health = await checker.check_all_components()
    return {
        "status": health.overall_status.value,
        "timestamp": health.timestamp,
        "components": [
            {
                "name": c.name,
                "status": c.status.value,
                "message": c.message,
                "response_time_ms": c.response_time_ms
            }
            for c in health.components
        ]
    }
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Execution Efficiency
- **Concurrent Execution**: All component health checks run in parallel via asyncio.gather
- **Timeout Protection**: Individual health checks cannot block overall system health monitoring
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal memory allocation with reusable health checker instances

### Reliability Features
- **Graceful Degradation**: Health monitoring continues even if individual components fail
- **Error Isolation**: Component failures do not impact other component health checks
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient failures

## Error Handling

### Exception Hierarchy
- **HealthCheckError**: Base class for health check infrastructure failures
- **HealthCheckTimeoutError**: Specific timeout-related failures for performance issues

### Failure Classification
- **HEALTHY**: All components operational with normal response times
- **DEGRADED**: Components operational but with performance issues or reduced functionality
- **UNHEALTHY**: Components experiencing critical failures or unavailability

## Integration Points

### Dependency Injection
Health checker integrates with FastAPI dependency injection system through `get_health_checker()`
dependency provider, enabling consistent health monitoring across all API endpoints.

### Monitoring Systems
Component status metadata and timing information provide comprehensive data for external
monitoring systems, alerting infrastructure, and operational dashboards.

### Cache Service Optimization
Cache health checks support dependency injection for optimal performance, reusing existing
cache service connections rather than creating new instances for each health check.

## Template Architecture Benefits

This health check infrastructure serves as a production-ready template component that:
- **Demonstrates Best Practices**: Showcases professional health monitoring patterns
- **Provides Reusable Patterns**: Ready-to-use health check infrastructure for any service
- **Enables Operational Excellence**: Comprehensive monitoring foundation for production deployments
- **Facilitates Testing**: Well-documented behavior contracts enable comprehensive test coverage

Template users can extend this infrastructure by implementing additional component health
checks following the established patterns while leveraging the robust orchestration and
policy management capabilities.

    Performs basic health validation for AI model services by checking configuration

    Returns:

    Behavior:
        - Validates AI service configuration without making external API calls
        - Checks for presence of required API keys and configuration parameters
        - Returns HEALTHY when AI services are properly configured and accessible
        - Returns DEGRADED when configuration is missing but service structure is intact

    Check cache system health and operational status using dependency injection for optimal performance.
    
    This function provides efficient cache health monitoring by accepting an optional cache service
    parameter for dependency injection. When a cache service is provided, it reuses existing
    connections and avoids redundant instantiation, making it ideal for frequent health checks.
    For backward compatibility, it falls back to creating a new cache service when none is provided.
    
    Args:
        cache_service: Optional AIResponseCache instance for optimal performance.
                      When provided, reuses existing connections and avoids instantiation overhead.

    Returns:
        ComponentStatus with cache connectivity and operational status
    
    Performance Notes:
        - ✅ OPTIMAL: When cache_service is provided, no instantiation overhead
        - ⚠️ FALLBACK: When cache_service is None, creates new service instance (less efficient)
