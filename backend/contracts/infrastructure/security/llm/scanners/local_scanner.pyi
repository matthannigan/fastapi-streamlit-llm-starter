Local LLM Security Scanner

This module provides a comprehensive local security scanning implementation using
production-ready ML libraries. It serves as a Python 3.13-compatible alternative
to the llm-guard package with equivalent or better functionality.

## Scanner Architecture

The local scanner implements a modular architecture with individual scanner
components for different security threats:

### Core Scanners
- **PromptInjectionScanner**: Detects prompt injection and jailbreak attempts
- **ToxicityScanner**: Identifies toxic or harmful content
- **PIIScanner**: Detects and handles personally identifiable information
- **BiasScanner**: Identifies potential bias in content

### Technology Stack
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face transformers for text classification
- **Presidio**: Microsoft's PII detection and anonymization
- **SpaCy**: Advanced NLP processing and entity recognition
- **PyTorch**: ML model execution and GPU acceleration

## Performance Characteristics

- **Input Scanning**: < 100ms for typical prompts
- **Output Scanning**: < 200ms for typical responses
- **Memory Usage**: ~500MB for all loaded models
- **Throughput**: 10+ concurrent scans with proper caching

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from app.infrastructure.security.llm.scanners.local_scanner import LocalLLMSecurityScanner
from app.infrastructure.security.llm.config import SecurityConfig, PresetName

# Create scanner with balanced preset
config = SecurityConfig.create_from_preset(PresetName.BALANCED)
scanner = LocalLLMSecurityScanner(config)

# Scan input
input_result = await scanner.validate_input("User message here")
if not input_result.is_safe:
    print(f"Threats detected: {len(input_result.violations)}")

# Scan output
output_result = await scanner.validate_output("AI response here")
```

### Custom Configuration
```python
from app.infrastructure.security.llm.config import ScannerConfig, ViolationAction

# Custom scanner configuration
config = SecurityConfig()
config.scanners[ScannerType.PROMPT_INJECTION] = ScannerConfig(
    enabled=True,
    threshold=0.8,
    action=ViolationAction.BLOCK,
    model_name="unitary/toxic-bert"
)

scanner = LocalLLMSecurityScanner(config)
```

## Model Caching

The scanner implements intelligent model caching:
- **Lazy Loading**: Models loaded only when needed
- **Memory Caching**: Models kept in memory for repeated use
- **Shared Resources**: Multiple scanners can share the same models
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of unused models

## Error Handling

The scanner provides comprehensive error handling:
- **Graceful Degradation**: Individual scanner failures don't crash the service
- **Fallback Strategies**: Alternative models when primary models fail
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive error logging and debugging information
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic recovery from transient failures

        Raises:
            SecurityServiceError: If cache clearing fails due to infrastructure issues
            InfrastructureError: If Redis connection fails or cache backend is unavailable
