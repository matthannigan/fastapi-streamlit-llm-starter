"""
Application-layer encryption for Redis cache data.

This module provides mandatory Fernet encryption for all cached data with transparent
operation. It ensures that all data stored in Redis is encrypted at rest using
application-layer encryption, providing an additional security layer beyond TLS.

## Security Features

- **Always-On Encryption**: All cache data is encrypted by default, no opt-out available
- **Fernet Encryption**: Uses industry-standard symmetric encryption from cryptography library
- **Key Management**: Secure encryption key management with environment-aware generation
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient encryption/decryption with minimal overhead
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of encryption failures and key rotation scenarios
- **Transparent Operation**: Seamless integration with existing cache operations

## Usage

```python
from app.infrastructure.cache.encryption import EncryptedCacheLayer

# Initialize with encryption key
encryption = EncryptedCacheLayer("your-fernet-key")

# Encrypt data before storage
encrypted_data = encryption.encrypt_cache_data({"key": "value"})

# Decrypt data after retrieval
original_data = encryption.decrypt_cache_data(encrypted_data)

# Check encryption status
if encryption.is_enabled:
    print("Data encryption is active")
```
