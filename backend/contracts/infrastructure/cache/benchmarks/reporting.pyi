"""
Comprehensive cache benchmark reporting with multi-format output and detailed analysis.

This module provides sophisticated report generation infrastructure for cache performance benchmarks
supporting multiple output formats including human-readable text, structured JSON, GitHub-compatible
markdown, and CI/CD optimized reports with performance badges and automated insights.

Classes:
    BenchmarkReporter: Abstract base class defining reporting interface with analysis utilities
    TextReporter: Human-readable console/log reports with configurable verbosity levels
    CIReporter: CI/CD pipeline optimized reports with badges, tables, and concise insights
    JSONReporter: Structured JSON output for API integration and programmatic processing
    MarkdownReporter: GitHub-flavored markdown with collapsible sections and performance tables
    ReporterFactory: Factory pattern for creating appropriate reporters with auto-detection

Key Features:
    - **Multi-Format Support**: Text, JSON, Markdown, and CI-specific formats with consistent
      analysis across all output types for different audiences and use cases.

    - **Performance Analysis**: Automated performance insights including threshold analysis,
      memory efficiency assessment, success rate evaluation, and variability detection.

    - **Actionable Recommendations**: Context-aware optimization recommendations based on
      performance patterns, memory usage, reliability metrics, and cache efficiency.

    - **CI/CD Integration**: Performance badges, GitHub Actions annotations, automated
      pass/fail determination, and concise insights optimized for pipeline integration.

    - **Configurable Verbosity**: Multiple detail levels from summary to comprehensive
      with customizable section inclusion for different reporting needs.

    - **Environment Detection**: Automatic format detection based on CI environment
      variables and configuration preferences for seamless integration.

Report Format Capabilities:
    **Text Reports**: Console-friendly output with sections for header, results, analysis,
    recommendations, and failures. Supports summary, standard, and detailed verbosity.

    **JSON Reports**: Structured data with schema versioning, computed metrics, analysis
    metadata, and complete benchmark preservation for API integration.

    **Markdown Reports**: GitHub-compatible format with performance tables, collapsible
    details, environment information, and emoji indicators for visual clarity.

    **CI Reports**: Pipeline-optimized format with performance badges, concise insights,
    summary tables, and quick assessment for automated deployment decisions.

Usage Examples:
    Multi-Format Report Generation:
        >>> from app.infrastructure.cache.benchmarks.reporting import ReporterFactory
        >>>
        >>> # Text report for console output
        >>> text_reporter = ReporterFactory.get_reporter("text")
        >>> text_report = text_reporter.generate_report(suite)
        >>> print(text_report)
        >>>
        >>> # CI report with badges
        >>> ci_reporter = ReporterFactory.get_reporter("ci")
        >>> ci_report = ci_reporter.generate_report(suite)
        >>>
        >>> # JSON for API integration
        >>> json_reporter = ReporterFactory.get_reporter("json")
        >>> json_report = json_reporter.generate_report(suite)

    Environment-Based Auto-Detection:
        >>> # Automatically detects CI environment
        >>> format = ReporterFactory.detect_format_from_environment()
        >>> reporter = ReporterFactory.get_reporter(format)
        >>>
        >>> # Generate all formats
        >>> all_reports = ReporterFactory.generate_all_reports(suite)
        >>> for format_name, report in all_reports.items():
        ...     with open(f"report.{format_name}", "w") as f:
        ...         f.write(report)

    Custom Configuration:
        >>> # Detailed text report with specific sections
        >>> text_reporter = TextReporter(
        ...     verbosity="detailed",
        ...     include_sections=["header", "results", "analysis"]
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> # JSON with metadata inclusion
        >>> json_reporter = JSONReporter(
        ...     include_metadata=True,
        ...     schema_version="2.0"
        ... )

Performance Considerations:
    - Report generation is optimized for minimal overhead during benchmark execution
    - Large dataset formatting is handled efficiently with streaming approaches
    - Multiple format generation uses shared analysis to minimize computation
    - Badge generation includes caching for repeated use in CI environments

Thread Safety:
    All reporter classes are stateless and thread-safe for concurrent report generation.
    Factory methods are safe for concurrent use across multiple benchmark executions.
