"""
[REFACTORED] Compatibility wrapper for maintaining backwards compatibility during cache transitions.

This module provides wrapper classes and utilities that ensure existing code
continues to work during the cache infrastructure refactoring. It acts as a
bridge between old and new cache implementations, allowing gradual migration
without breaking existing functionality.

Classes:
    CompatibilityWrapper: Main wrapper class that provides backwards compatibility
                         for existing cache interfaces while delegating to new
                         implementations internally.

Key Features:
    - Seamless integration with existing codebase during transition period
    - Method mapping between old and new cache interface signatures
    - Deprecation warnings for old patterns with migration guidance
    - Configurable compatibility modes (strict, permissive, migration)
    - Performance metrics to track usage of legacy vs new patterns
    - Automatic fallback mechanisms for unsupported operations

Example:
    ```python
    >>> # Existing code continues to work unchanged
    >>> old_cache = AIResponseCache()  # Legacy interface
    >>> wrapper = CompatibilityWrapper(
    ...     legacy_cache=old_cache,
    ...     new_cache=GenericRedisCache(),
    ...     mode="migration"  # Provides warnings but maintains compatibility
    ... )
    >>> 
    >>> # Legacy methods still work but internally use new implementation
    >>> result = await wrapper.get_ai_response(prompt_hash)
    >>> await wrapper.store_ai_response(prompt_hash, response, ttl=3600)
    ```

Note:
    This is a Phase-1 scaffolding stub. Implementation will be added in
    subsequent phases of the cache refactoring project. This wrapper is
    intended to be temporary and will be deprecated once migration is complete.

class CacheCompatibilityWrapper:
    """
    Compatibility wrapper enabling seamless migration between cache implementations with deprecation management.
    
    Provides backwards compatibility during cache refactoring by proxying legacy method calls
    to new cache implementations while emitting configurable deprecation warnings and
    maintaining compatibility metrics for migration tracking.
    
    Attributes:
        inner_cache: Any underlying cache implementation to delegate operations to
        emit_warnings: bool whether to emit deprecation warnings for legacy usage
        compatibility_metrics: Dict[str, int] tracking usage of legacy vs new patterns
        
    Public Methods:
        All legacy cache methods with automatic delegation to inner cache
        get_compatibility_metrics(): Retrieve usage statistics for migration planning
        
    State Management:
        - Thread-safe proxying of all cache operations to underlying implementation
        - Configurable warning system for gradual migration assistance
        - Compatibility metrics collection for migration progress tracking
        - Temporary bridge designed for removal after complete migration
        
    Usage:
        # Wrap new cache implementation for legacy compatibility
        new_cache = GenericRedisCache(redis_url="redis://localhost:6379")
        wrapper = CacheCompatibilityWrapper(new_cache, emit_warnings=True)
        
        # Legacy code continues working with deprecation warnings
        await wrapper.set("key", "value")  # Warns about deprecated usage
        result = await wrapper.get("key")
        
        # Migration monitoring
        metrics = wrapper.get_compatibility_metrics()
        legacy_usage = metrics.get("legacy_method_calls", 0)
        
        # Production usage with warnings disabled
        prod_wrapper = CacheCompatibilityWrapper(
            inner_cache=production_cache,
            emit_warnings=False  # Disable warnings in production
        )
    result = await wrapper.get_cached_response(text, operation, options)
