class ConfigurationPerformanceBenchmark:
    """
    Comprehensive performance benchmarking suite for resilience configuration loading and validation.
    
    Provides detailed performance testing and monitoring for the resilience configuration system
    with a target of <100ms loading time. Implements comprehensive metrics collection,
    regression detection, and performance trend analysis to ensure configuration system
    meets production performance requirements.
    
    Attributes:
        results: List of BenchmarkResult objects storing all benchmark execution results
        baseline_results: Dictionary mapping operation names to baseline performance metrics
                         for regression detection and performance comparison
    
    Public Methods:
        measure_performance(): Core performance measurement with timing and memory tracking

        - Results accumulation within single benchmark session for trend analysis
        - Memory-efficient with automatic cleanup of completed benchmark runs
    
    Usage:
        # Basic benchmarking
        benchmark = ConfigurationPerformanceBenchmark()
    
        # Run specific benchmark
        result = benchmark.benchmark_preset_loading(iterations=100)
        print(f"Preset loading: {result.avg_duration_ms:.2f}ms avg")
    
        # Run comprehensive suite
        suite = benchmark.run_comprehensive_benchmark()
        print(f"Overall pass rate: {suite.pass_rate:.1%}")
    
        # Generate detailed report
        report = benchmark.generate_performance_report(suite)
        print(report)
    
        # Analyze performance trends
        trends = benchmark.analyze_performance_trends([suite1, suite2, suite3])

        Measure operation performance with comprehensive timing and memory tracking.
        
        Core performance measurement method that executes the specified operation multiple
        times while collecting detailed metrics including timing statistics, memory usage,
        success rates, and execution metadata. Uses tracemalloc for accurate memory
        tracking and high-precision timing for performance analysis.
        
        Args:

            iterations: Number of iterations to execute for statistical significance.
                        Must be positive integer, higher values provide more accurate averages

            - success_rate: Ratio of successful executions to total iterations
            - metadata: Operation-specific metadata provided during execution

            - Captures exceptions and calculates success/failure rates
            - Computes statistical metrics (mean, min, max, standard deviation)
            - Stores results in internal results list for later analysis
            - Logs completion with average execution time for monitoring
        
        Raises:
            No exceptions raised - all execution errors captured in result metadata
