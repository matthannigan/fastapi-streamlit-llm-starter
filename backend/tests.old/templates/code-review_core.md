# Core Tests Review Template - [CORE_AREA]

> **Instructions:** Replace `[CORE_AREA]` with the actual core area (e.g., "Configuration Management", "Dependency Injection", "Application Setup"). 
> This template helps systematically review core tests to ensure they meet our criteria.

## Review Criteria for Core Tests

Core tests should meet these criteria:
- ✅ **Application-specific setup** - Test configuration loading, validation, and initialization
- ✅ **Infrastructure-domain bridge** - Test components that connect infrastructure to business logic
- ✅ **Dependency injection** - Test proper wiring of services and configuration management
- ✅ **Middleware & cross-cutting concerns** - Test CORS, error handling, logging, and request processing
- ✅ **Configuration validation** - Test environment-specific settings and validation rules

## Files to Review

> **Instructions:** 
> 1. List all test files in the `backend/tests/core/` directory
> 2. Group them by logical categories (examples below)
> 3. Include file sizes and line counts for context
> 4. Use checkboxes `[ ]` initially, then mark `[x]` when reviewed
> 5. Add status indicators: **✅ PROPER CORE**, **❌ MOVE TO [DIRECTORY]**, **⚠️ PLACEHOLDER**

## Review Notes

### Completed Reviews

> **Instructions:** For each file reviewed, add an entry like this:

**[N]. `test_[core_component].py` [STATUS_ICON] [CLASSIFICATION]**
   - [Key findings about what core functionality is tested]
   - [Assessment of application-specific setup and configuration]
   - [Notes about infrastructure-domain bridging]
   - [Coverage of dependency injection and middleware]
   - Status: [Current location assessment and recommendation]

> **Status Icons:** ✅ ❌ ⚠️
> **Classifications:** 
> - **PROPER CORE** - correctly located and designed for core application setup
> - **MISPLACED - [TEST_TYPE]** - should be moved to different directory (e.g., infrastructure, services, api)
> - **PLACEHOLDER FILE** - contains only placeholder tests

### Issues Found

> **Instructions:** List all issues discovered during review:

1. **[Issue category]** ([file names]) [description]
2. **[Issue category]** ([file names]) [description]

> **Common issue categories:**
> - Placeholder files, Infrastructure logic in core tests, Business logic in core tests, Missing configuration validation, Improper dependency wiring, etc.

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Move misplaced tests:**
   - Move `test_[file].py` → `tests/[correct_directory]/test_[new_name].py`

2. **Complete placeholder tests:**
   - Implement `test_[file].py` with actual [core] tests
   - Or remove if core functionality is covered elsewhere

3. **Fix core test violations:**
   - [Specific recommendations for files that don't meet core testing criteria]

#### Overall Assessment

> **Instructions:** Provide overall assessment using this structure:

**[ASSESSMENT_LEVEL]** core test compliance! [Brief summary]

- ✅/❌ **Application-specific setup** - [Assessment details]
- ✅/❌ **Infrastructure-domain bridging** - [Assessment details]  
- ✅/❌ **Dependency injection testing** - [Assessment details]
- ✅/❌ **Middleware & cross-cutting concerns** - [Assessment details]
- ✅/❌ **Configuration validation** - [Assessment details]

**Key Strengths:**
- [List major strengths found in the core test suite]

**Areas for Improvement:**
- [List areas that need attention for better core testing coverage]

> **Assessment levels:** EXCELLENT, GOOD, FAIR, NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

## Review Progress

> **Instructions:** Update these metrics as you progress:

**Started:** [DATE]
**Files Reviewed:** [X]/[TOTAL] ([PERCENTAGE]% complete)
**Issues Found:** [COUNT] ([breakdown by type])
**Recommendations Made:** [COUNT]

## Usage Instructions

### How to Use This Template

1. **Preparation:**
   - Copy this template to `backend/tests/core/core_review.md`
   - Replace `[CORE_AREA]` with your actual core area name
   - List all test files in the core directory

2. **File Discovery:**
   ```bash
   # Get file list with sizes
   ls -la backend/tests/core/
   
   # Get line counts for all core test files
   wc -l backend/tests/core/*.py
   ```

3. **Review Process:**
   - Read each test file systematically
   - Check against core test criteria
   - Look for application setup, configuration management, dependency injection
   - Assess middleware testing and cross-cutting concerns
   - Note coverage gaps in configuration validation and initialization

4. **Classification Guidelines:**
   - **✅ PROPER CORE:** Tests application setup, configuration, dependency injection, middleware
   - **❌ MOVE TO INFRASTRUCTURE:** Tests individual infrastructure components in isolation
   - **❌ MOVE TO SERVICES:** Tests business logic without application setup concerns
   - **❌ MOVE TO API:** Tests HTTP endpoints using FastAPI TestClient
   - **❌ MOVE TO INTEGRATION:** Tests cross-layer interactions beyond core setup
   - **⚠️ PLACEHOLDER:** Only contains TODO or empty tests

5. **Final Steps:**
   - Add TODO comments to misplaced files
   - Update progress tracking
   - Provide comprehensive recommendations
