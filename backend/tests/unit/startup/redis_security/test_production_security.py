Unit tests for RedisSecurityValidator production security validation.

This test module verifies that the RedisSecurityValidator class properly enforces
production security requirements as documented in the public contract, including
TLS validation, environment-aware enforcement, and insecure override handling.

Test Coverage:
    - Production environment TLS requirement enforcement
    - Development environment security flexibility
    - Staging environment security behavior
    - Insecure override handling and warning generation
    - Error messages and configuration guidance
    - Success confirmation logging
