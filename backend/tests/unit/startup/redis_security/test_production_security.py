            robustness for edge cases.

        Scenario:
            Given: Empty string or None as redis_url
            When: _is_secure_connection() is called
            Then: Method returns False without errors
            And: No exceptions are raised

        Test that _is_secure_connection() handles malformed URLs safely.

        Verifies:
            _is_secure_connection() returns False for malformed URLs

        Business Impact:
            Ensures validation remains robust even with invalid input,
            failing safely rather than crashing.

        Scenario:
            Given: Malformed Redis URL (missing scheme, invalid format)
            When: _is_secure_connection() is called
            Then: Method returns False
            And: No exceptions are raised

        Verifies:
            _is_secure_connection() only considers redis:// secure when

        Business Impact:
            Ensures consistent security standards where plain connections
            must have authentication to be considered secure.

        Scenario:
            Given: Two redis:// URLs, one with auth, one without
            When: _is_secure_connection() is called on each
