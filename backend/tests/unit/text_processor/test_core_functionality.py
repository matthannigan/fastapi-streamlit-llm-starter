"""
Test skeletons for TextProcessorService core processing functionality.

This module contains test skeletons for verifying the main text processing
operations through the process_text() public method, including all supported
operations (SUMMARIZE, SENTIMENT, KEY_POINTS, QUESTIONS, QA).

Test Strategy:
    - Test each operation type through process_text() public interface
    - Test successful processing with AI agent responses
    - Test response structure and field population
    - Test metadata generation and processing time tracking

Coverage Focus:
    - process_text() method for all operation types
    - Operation dispatch to appropriate handlers
    - Response field population based on operation
    - Processing metadata and timing
