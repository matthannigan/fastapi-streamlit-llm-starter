# Text Processor Unit Test Implementation Batches

This document organizes unit test skeleton files for the text_processor module into manageable implementation batches.

## Component Overview

**Component**: `text_processor`
**Contract**: `backend/contracts/services/text_processor.pyi`
**Total Test Files**: 5
**Total Batches**: 1

## Batch 1: Core Text Processor Functionality

**Batch Size**: 5 files
**Focus**: Complete test coverage for text processor service

### Required Files

#### Contract File
- `backend/contracts/services/text_processor.pyi`
  - Public interface definition for the text processor service
  - Defines all public methods, signatures, and return types

#### Component Fixtures
- `backend/tests/unit/text_processor/conftest.py`
  - Shared fixtures for text processor tests
  - Common test data and mock configurations

#### Test Files for Implementation

1. **`backend/tests/unit/text_processor/test_initialization.py`**
   - Tests for service initialization and configuration
   - Constructor behavior and dependency injection

2. **`backend/tests/unit/text_processor/test_core_functionality.py`**
   - Tests for primary text processing operations
   - Core business logic and transformation methods

3. **`backend/tests/unit/text_processor/test_batch_processing.py`**
   - Tests for batch text processing capabilities
   - Performance and efficiency optimizations

4. **`backend/tests/unit/text_processor/test_caching_behavior.py`**
   - Tests for caching mechanisms and cache invalidation
   - Performance optimization through intelligent caching

5. **`backend/tests/unit/text_processor/test_error_handling.py`**
   - Tests for error conditions and exception handling
   - Edge cases and fault tolerance

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with `test_initialization.py`**: Establish baseline functionality
2. **Proceed to `test_core_functionality.py`**: Implement primary use cases
3. **Continue with specialized functionality**: Batch processing and caching
4. **Finish with `test_error_handling.py`**: Comprehensive edge case coverage

### Notes

- All 5 test files can be implemented in a single batch since they don't exceed the 5-file limit
- Tests share common fixtures through the component `conftest.py`
- Implementation should follow docstring-driven test development patterns
- Each test file should focus on specific aspects of the text processor service
