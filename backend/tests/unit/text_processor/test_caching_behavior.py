"""
Test skeletons for TextProcessorService caching behavior.

This module contains test skeletons for verifying cache-first strategy,
cache key generation, cache hit/miss behavior, TTL management, and cache
storage after successful processing.

Test Strategy:
    - Test cache-first lookup before AI processing
    - Test cache key generation with operation-specific parameters
    - Test cache hit returns cached response immediately
    - Test cache miss triggers AI processing
    - Test cache storage after successful processing
    - Test operation-specific TTL values

Coverage Focus:
    - Cache-first strategy in process_text()
    - _build_cache_key() behavior through caching
    - _get_ttl_for_operation() through cache storage
    - Cache hit/miss metadata in responses

    Verifies end-to-end cache behavior including lookup, miss handling,
    storage, and cache hit scenarios in complete processing workflows.
    
    Business Impact:
        Comprehensive cache integration ensures caching works correctly
        across all processing scenarios for cost and performance benefits.

        Test first request stores in cache, second identical request hits cache.

        Verifies:
            Complete cache workflow where first request processes and stores,
            second identical request retrieves from cache without processing.

        Business Impact:
            Demonstrates full cache value proposition where repeated requests
            benefit from caching for cost reduction and speed improvement.

        Scenario:
            Given: Empty fake cache initially
            When: First process_text() request is made
            Then: AI processing occurs and stores in cache (cache_hit=False)
            When: Second identical request is made
            Then: Cached response returned immediately (cache_hit=True)
            And: AI agent not called for second request
            And: Second request much faster than first

        Fixtures Used:
            - test_settings: Real Settings instance
            - fake_cache: Initially empty fake cache

        Test cache correctly isolates different requests with unique keys.

        Verifies:
            Cache properly distinguishes between different texts, operations,
            and options to prevent incorrect cache hits.

        Business Impact:
            Ensures cache correctness by preventing inappropriate cache hits
            that would return wrong responses for different requests.

        Scenario:
            Given: Multiple requests with variations (text, operation, options)
            When: Requests are processed sequentially
            Then: Each unique combination triggers AI processing (cache miss)
            And: Identical combinations hit cache (cache hit)
            And: No incorrect cache hits between different requests

        Fixtures Used:
            - test_settings: Real Settings instance
            - fake_cache: Fake cache tracking all entries

        Verifies:
            When multiple identical requests arrive concurrently, cache behavior
            remains correct without race conditions or duplicate processing.

        Business Impact:
            Ensures cache reliability under concurrent load without duplication
            of AI processing for simultaneous identical requests.

        Scenario:
            Given: Multiple identical requests arriving concurrently
            When: All requests are processed simultaneously
            Then: Cache behavior remains correct
            And: Either all hit cache or first stores while others wait
