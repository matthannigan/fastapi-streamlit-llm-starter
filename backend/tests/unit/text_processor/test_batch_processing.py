"""
Test skeletons for TextProcessorService batch processing functionality.

This module contains test skeletons for verifying the process_batch() method,
including concurrent processing, concurrency limits, individual request isolation,
failure handling, and batch result aggregation.

Test Strategy:
    - Test concurrent processing of multiple requests
    - Test concurrency semaphore limiting
    - Test individual request isolation (failures don't affect others)
    - Test batch result aggregation and status tracking
    - Test batch_id generation and tracking
    - Test processing time tracking for entire batch

Coverage Focus:
    - process_batch() method behavior
    - Concurrent request processing with asyncio
    - Semaphore-based concurrency control
    - Individual request error isolation
    - Batch result aggregation and metadata

        Test duplicate requests within same batch leverage caching.

        Verifies:
            When batch contains identical requests, first processes and caches,
            subsequent identical requests hit cache within same batch.

        Business Impact:
            Optimizes processing of batches with duplicate requests by avoiding
            redundant AI processing within single batch execution.

        Scenario:
            Given: Batch with 2 identical requests (same text, operation, options)
            When: process_batch() processes all requests
            Then: First request processes with AI and stores in cache
            And: Second identical request hits cache (cache_hit=True)
            And: Only one AI call is made for duplicate requests

        Fixtures Used:
            - test_settings: Real Settings instance
            - fake_cache: Empty fake cache
            - mock_pydantic_agent: Mock AI agent

        Observable Behavior:
            Can verify through cache hit counts and AI agent call counts
            showing optimization for duplicate requests.

        Known Limitation:
            This test currently fails due to concurrent batch processing race condition.
            In concurrent execution, all requests check cache before any complete storing,
            causing redundant AI calls. This is a known architectural limitation that
            requires either cache-level locking or batch-level request deduplication.
