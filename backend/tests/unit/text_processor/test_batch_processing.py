Test skeletons for TextProcessorService batch processing functionality.

This module contains test skeletons for verifying the process_batch() method,
including concurrent processing, concurrency limits, individual request isolation,
failure handling, and batch result aggregation.

Test Strategy:
    - Test concurrent processing of multiple requests
    - Test concurrency semaphore limiting
    - Test individual request isolation (failures don't affect others)
    - Test batch result aggregation and status tracking
    - Test batch_id generation and tracking
    - Test processing time tracking for entire batch

Coverage Focus:
    - process_batch() method behavior
    - Concurrent request processing with asyncio
    - Semaphore-based concurrency control
    - Individual request error isolation
    - Batch result aggregation and metadata

    Verifies that batch processing leverages caching correctly for each

    Business Impact:
        Caching in batch processing reduces costs and improves performance
        when batch contains duplicate or previously-processed requests.

        """
        Test individual requests in batch can hit cache independently.
        
        Verifies:
            Each request in batch follows normal cache-first strategy,
            enabling cache hits for individual requests within batch.
        
        Business Impact:
            Reduces AI processing costs when batch contains requests with
            cached responses from previous executions.
        
        Scenario:
            Given: Batch with 5 requests, 2 have cached responses

            Each successfully processed request in batch stores result in
            cache for future cache hits.
        
        Business Impact:
            Builds cache from batch processing, improving future performance

            When batch contains identical requests, first processes and caches,
            subsequent identical requests hit cache within same batch.
        
        Business Impact:
            Optimizes processing of batches with duplicate requests by avoiding
            redundant AI processing within single batch execution.
        
        Scenario:
            Given: Batch with 2 identical requests (same text, operation, options)
