"""
Test skeletons for TextProcessorService error handling and fallback behavior.

This module contains test skeletons for verifying error handling across
the processing pipeline, including input validation, AI service failures,
validation errors, fallback response generation, and graceful degradation.

Test Strategy:
    - Test input validation errors (missing required parameters)
    - Test AI service failure handling and retries
    - Test validation failure handling
    - Test fallback response generation when AI unavailable
    - Test graceful degradation scenarios
    - Test error logging and metadata

Coverage Focus:
    - ValueError for invalid inputs
    - ServiceUnavailableError handling
    - TransientAIError handling
    - Fallback response generation (_get_fallback_response)
    - Default fallback creation (_get_default_fallback)
    - Graceful degradation metadata

        Business Impact:
            Enables monitoring of service degradation and provides transparency
            to users about response quality and source.

            Improves fallback response quality over time by building cache

            Individual request failures don't affect service's ability to
            process subsequent requests successfully.
        
        Business Impact:
            Ensures service resilience where one failure doesn't cascade
