"""
Test skeletons for TextProcessorService initialization and configuration validation.

This module contains test skeletons for verifying the initialization behavior
of the TextProcessorService, including settings validation, cache service setup,
AI agent configuration, and operation registry validation.

Test Strategy:
    - Test component initialization with various configurations
    - Test operation registry validation
    - Test dependency injection and wiring
    - Test configuration error handling

Coverage Focus:
    - __init__() method behavior
    - _validate_operation_registry() indirect testing
    - _register_operations() indirect testing
    - Settings and cache service integration
