Test suite for LocalLLMSecurityScanner operational methods.

This module tests the operational and maintenance methods of LocalLLMSecurityScanner
including cache management, metrics retrieval, configuration access, and service
operations using REAL components with mocked external dependencies.

Component Under Test:
    LocalLLMSecurityScanner operational methods (clear_cache, get_metrics, etc.)

Test Strategy:
    - Test cache clearing operations with real cache behavior
    - Verify metrics collection and retrieval from real scanner
    - Test configuration access methods
    - Verify cache statistics reporting from real cache
    - Test metrics reset functionality with real state changes
