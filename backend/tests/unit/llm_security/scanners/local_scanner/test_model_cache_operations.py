"""
Test suite for ModelCache core caching operations.

This module tests the core model caching functionality of ModelCache,
verifying correct model loading, caching, retrieval, and statistics tracking
according to its documented contract using REAL components with mocked external dependencies.

Component Under Test:
    ModelCache - Thread-safe model cache with lazy loading and file locking

Test Strategy:
    - Test model loading and caching workflow with real cache behavior
    - Verify cache hit and cache miss scenarios with actual caching logic
    - Test file locking for concurrent downloads (real behavior)
    - Verify statistics tracking accuracy from real cache implementation
    - Test cache management operations (clear, preload) with real effects
    - Test error handling during model loading with proper exception propagation

    Test suite for ModelCache.get_model() method.

    Verifies the core model retrieval and caching behavior including lazy loading,

    Scope:
        - Model loading on cache miss
        - Model retrieval on cache hit
        - File locking for concurrent downloads
        - Performance tracking and statistics

    Business Impact:
        Correct caching ensures optimal performance by avoiding redundant model
        loads while maintaining thread safety for concurrent scanner operations.
