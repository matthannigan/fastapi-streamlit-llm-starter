"""
Test suite for ModelCache core caching operations.

This module tests the core model caching functionality of ModelCache,
verifying correct model loading, caching, retrieval, and statistics tracking
according to its documented contract.

Component Under Test:
    ModelCache - Thread-safe model cache with lazy loading and file locking

Test Strategy:
    - Test model loading and caching workflow
    - Verify cache hit and cache miss scenarios
    - Test file locking for concurrent downloads
    - Verify statistics tracking accuracy
    - Test cache management operations (clear, preload)
    - Test error handling during model loading

    Test suite for ModelCache.get_model() method.
    
    Verifies the core model retrieval and caching behavior including lazy loading,
    cache hits, file locking for concurrent access, and error handling during
    model loading operations.
    
    Scope:
        - Model loading on cache miss
        - Model retrieval on cache hit
        - File locking for concurrent downloads
        - Performance tracking and statistics
        - Error propagation from loader functions
        - Thread safety for concurrent get_model calls
    
    Business Impact:
        Correct caching ensures optimal performance by avoiding redundant model
        loads while maintaining thread safety for concurrent scanner operations.
