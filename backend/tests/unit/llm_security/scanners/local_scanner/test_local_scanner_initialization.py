    Test suite for LocalLLMSecurityScanner.initialize() method.

    Verifies the explicit initialization method that prepares cache and
    configurations for lazy-loaded scanners, supporting warmup scenarios.

    Scope:
        - Cache and configuration initialization
        - Lazy loading enablement
        - Idempotent initialization behavior
        - Infrastructure setup

    Business Impact:
        Explicit initialization enables warm-up workflows and verification
        of scanner service readiness before handling requests.
