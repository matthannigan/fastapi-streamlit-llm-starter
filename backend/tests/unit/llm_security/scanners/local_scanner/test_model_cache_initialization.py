"""
Test suite for ModelCache initialization and configuration.

This module tests the initialization behavior of the ModelCache component,
verifying that it correctly sets up ONNX providers, cache directories, and
internal state management according to its documented contract.

Component Under Test:
    ModelCache - Thread-safe model cache for managing ML model instances

Test Strategy:
    - Test initialization with various ONNX provider configurations
    - Verify cache directory creation and path management
    - Test default configuration behavior
    - Verify thread-safe initialization of internal state
    - Test error handling for invalid initialization parameters

    Test suite for ModelCache initialization behavior.
    
    Verifies that ModelCache correctly initializes with various configurations,
    sets up required infrastructure (cache directories, ONNX providers), and
    establishes thread-safe internal state management.
    
    Scope:
        - Constructor parameter handling
        - ONNX provider configuration and validation
        - Cache directory creation and setup
        - Internal state initialization
