"""
Test suite for ModelCache initialization and configuration.

This module tests the initialization behavior of the ModelCache component,
verifying that it correctly sets up ONNX providers, cache directories, and
internal state management according to its documented contract.

Component Under Test:
    ModelCache - Thread-safe model cache for managing ML model instances

Test Strategy:
    - Test initialization with various ONNX provider configurations using REAL components
    - Verify cache directory creation and path management with actual behavior
    - Test default configuration behavior with real ModelCache
    - Verify thread-safe initialization of internal state
    - Test error handling for invalid initialization parameters

Testing Philosophy:
    Uses REAL ModelCache with mocked EXTERNAL dependencies only.
    Tests actual initialization behavior rather than mock interactions.
    Follows boundary testing principles by mocking only ONNX, Transformers, Presidio, Redis.

    Scope:
        - Constructor parameter handling
