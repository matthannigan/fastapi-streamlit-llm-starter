        Business Impact:
            Ensures all predefined configuration templates are available for

            Ensures preset names can be used in configuration files and

        Business Impact:
            Enables graduated security policies where environments determine

        Scenario:
            Given: PresetName enum members ordered by security strictness.

            and environment-based presets (DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION) per contract.

        Business Impact:
            Enables flexible preset selection based on either security requirements
