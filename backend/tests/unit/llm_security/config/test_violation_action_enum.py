        Test that ViolationAction enum includes all documented action types.

            ViolationAction enum contains NONE, WARN, BLOCK, REDACT, and FLAG

        Business Impact:
            Ensures all violation response strategies are available for security
            policy configuration.

        Scenario:
            Given: ViolationAction enum imported.
            When: Action type attributes are accessed.
            Then: All five action types exist with correct values.

        Business Impact:
            Ensures action types can be serialized to configuration files and
            JSON responses.

        Scenario:
            Given: Any ViolationAction enum member.
            When: Type is checked.

        Business Impact:
            Enables graduated response policies where violation severity determines
            intervention level.

        Scenario:
            Given: ViolationAction enum members ordered by intervention level.

            ViolationAction enums integrate with ScannerConfig for action policy

        Business Impact:
            Enables configuring scanner-specific response actions through enum
            values for type-safe configuration.

        Scenario:
            Given: ViolationAction member (e.g., BLOCK).

            ViolationAction string inheritance allows comparison with plain strings

        Business Impact:
            Enables flexible configuration parsing where string action values can
            be validated against enum members.
