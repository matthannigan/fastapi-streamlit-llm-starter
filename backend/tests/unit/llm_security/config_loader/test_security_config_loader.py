        Business Impact:
            Ensures configuration changes are picked up after TTL expiration for
            reasonable refresh frequency.

        Scenario:
            Given: SecurityConfigLoader with cache_ttl=300 and cached configuration.

        Business Impact:
            Enables automatic cache invalidation when configuration files change
            without manual cache clearing.

        Scenario:
            Given: SecurityConfigLoader with cached configuration.
