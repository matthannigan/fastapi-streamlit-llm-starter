            CacheEntry dataclass properly initializes with complete field set including
            SecurityResult, timestamps, cache key, configuration hash, version, TTL, and hit count.

        Business Impact:
            Ensures cache entries contain all metadata necessary for cache management,
            performance monitoring, and configuration change detection.

        Scenario:
            Given: A valid SecurityResult object and complete metadata parameters.

            from_dict() gracefully handles dictionaries missing optional fields like hit_count,
            using appropriate defaults as documented in the contract.

        Business Impact:
            Ensures backward compatibility when deserializing cache entries created with
            earlier versions that may have fewer fields.
