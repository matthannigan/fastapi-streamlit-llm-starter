"""
Unit tests for ONNXProviderManager component.

This test suite verifies the ONNXProviderManager's contract for ONNX Runtime
execution provider detection, configuration, and optimization. Tests focus on
observable behavior of the complete provider manager as a unit.

Component Under Test:
    ONNXProviderManager - Execution provider detection and configuration service

Test Strategy:
    - Treat provider manager as complete unit (not testing internal detection logic)
    - Mock only external dependency: ONNX Runtime provider API
    - Test observable outcomes: provider lists, session options, provider info
    - Verify caching behavior through repeated calls

External Dependencies Mocked:
    - ONNX Runtime (onnxruntime library) - Provider detection and availability
    - System hardware detection - For GPU/NPU availability checks

Fixtures Used:
    - mock_onnx_provider_manager: Factory for creating provider manager instances
    - onnx_provider_test_data: Test data for various provider scenarios
    - onnx_session_options_test_data: Test data for session configuration
