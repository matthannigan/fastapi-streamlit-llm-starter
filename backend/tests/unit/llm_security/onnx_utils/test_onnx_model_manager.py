"""
Unit tests for ONNXModelManager component.

This test suite verifies the ONNXModelManager's contract for high-level ONNX model
management including loading, unloading, caching, and compatibility verification.
Tests focus on observable behavior of the complete manager as a unit.

Component Under Test:
    ONNXModelManager - High-level model management orchestration service

Test Strategy:
    - Treat manager as complete unit (not testing internal downloader/provider components separately)
    - Mock only external dependencies: file system, ONNX Runtime, transformers library
    - Test observable outcomes: model loading success/failure, cache state, model info
    - Verify provider fallback and error recovery behavior

External Dependencies Mocked:
    - ONNX Runtime (onnxruntime library) - Model loading and inference sessions
    - Transformers library (transformers) - Tokenizer loading
    - File system - Via temporary directories for cache testing

Fixtures Used:
    - mock_onnx_model_manager: Factory for creating manager instances
    - onnx_test_models: Test data for various model scenarios
    - onnx_provider_test_data: Test data for provider configurations
    - onnx_tmp_model_cache: Temporary cache directory
