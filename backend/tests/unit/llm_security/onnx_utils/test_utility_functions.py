"""
Unit tests for ONNX Utils utility functions.

This test suite verifies the utility functions (get_onnx_manager, verify_onnx_setup)
and dataclass behaviors (ONNXModelInfo, ProviderInfo) according to their documented
contracts. Tests focus on observable behavior and proper data structure handling.

Components Under Test:
    - get_onnx_manager(): Global singleton manager factory function
    - verify_onnx_setup(): ONNX Runtime ecosystem verification utility
    - ONNXModelInfo: Model metadata dataclass
    - ProviderInfo: Provider information dataclass

Test Strategy:
    - Test utility functions as complete units with observable outcomes
    - Test dataclasses for proper initialization and attribute access
    - Mock only external dependencies (ONNX Runtime, file system)
    - Verify comprehensive diagnostic information from verification function

External Dependencies Mocked:
    - ONNX Runtime (onnxruntime library) - For setup verification
    - File system - For model file checks
    - Network - For download capability checks

Fixtures Used:
    - mock_onnx_model_info: Factory for creating model info instances
    - mock_provider_info: Factory for creating provider info instances
    - onnx_test_models: Test data for model scenarios
    - onnx_provider_test_data: Test data for provider scenarios
