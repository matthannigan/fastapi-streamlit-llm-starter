"""
Test suite for security protocol enumeration types.

This module tests the ViolationType and SeverityLevel enums that define the
taxonomy of security threats and their classification hierarchy. These enums
are foundational to the security system's violation reporting and risk assessment.

Test Strategy:
    - Verify enum value definitions and string representations
    - Test enum member access and iteration
    - Validate enum usage in violation classification
    - Ensure consistency across the security system
