Test suite for MetricsSnapshot dataclass providing system-wide metrics view.

This module tests the MetricsSnapshot dataclass that captures a comprehensive
point-in-time view of security service metrics, system health, and operational
status for monitoring, alerting, and performance analysis.

Test Strategy:
    - Verify initialization with required and optional fields
    - Test to_dict() serialization for monitoring systems
    - Validate derived metrics calculation (success rates)
    - Test timestamp handling and system health integration
    - Verify comprehensive snapshot coverage
