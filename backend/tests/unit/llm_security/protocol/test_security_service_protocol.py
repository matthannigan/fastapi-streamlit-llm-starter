"""
Test suite for SecurityService protocol defining security scanner interface.

This module tests the SecurityService abstract protocol that establishes the
standardized contract for all security scanning implementations. Tests verify
protocol method signatures, abstract method requirements, and interface completeness.

Test Strategy:
    - Verify protocol defines all required abstract methods
    - Test method signature correctness (parameters, return types)
    - Validate that protocol is abstract and cannot be instantiated
    - Verify protocol can be used as type hint for implementations
    - Test protocol inheritance and subclass requirements
