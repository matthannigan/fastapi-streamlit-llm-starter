Test suite for ScanMetrics dataclass tracking security scan performance.

This module tests the ScanMetrics dataclass that accumulates comprehensive
performance and operational statistics about security scanning operations
including scan counts, timing data, success rates, and violation detection.

Test Strategy:
    - Verify initialization with default zero values
    - Test update() method for metric accumulation
    - Validate average scan time calculation logic
    - Test reset() method for clearing accumulated data
    - Verify metric integrity across multiple updates
