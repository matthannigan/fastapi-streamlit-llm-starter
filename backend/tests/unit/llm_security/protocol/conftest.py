"""
Protocol module test fixtures.

This module provides test fixtures for the LLM security protocol module.
Since the protocol module contains only abstract interfaces, enums, and dataclasses
with no external dependencies, no specific fixtures are required.

The protocol module components can be tested directly by importing and instantiating
the concrete classes defined in the .pyi file.

# No fixtures needed - protocol module has no external dependencies
# All components (enums, dataclasses, abstract classes) can be tested directly
