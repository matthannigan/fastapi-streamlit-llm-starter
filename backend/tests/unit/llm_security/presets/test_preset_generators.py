Unit tests for preset generator functions.

This test module verifies the preset generator functions that create environment-specific
security configurations: get_development_preset(), get_production_preset(), and
get_testing_preset().

Test Strategy:
    - Component Under Test: Preset generator functions in app.infrastructure.security.llm.presets
    - Testing Approach: Black-box testing through public API only
    - No Mocking: Pure functions with no external dependencies
    - Contract Source: backend/contracts/infrastructure/security/llm/presets.pyi

Fixtures Available:
    From conftest.py (backend/tests/unit/llm_security/presets/conftest.py):
