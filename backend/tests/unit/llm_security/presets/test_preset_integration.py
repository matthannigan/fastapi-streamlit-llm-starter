Unit tests for preset module integration and edge cases.

This test module verifies integration scenarios between preset functions and
edge cases that don't fit into specific function categories. Tests focus on
how the preset functions work together and handle boundary conditions.

Test Strategy:
    - Component Under Test: Integration of all preset module functions
    - Testing Approach: Black-box testing of function interactions
    - No Mocking: Pure functions with no external dependencies
    - Contract Source: backend/contracts/infrastructure/security/llm/presets.pyi

Fixtures Available:
    From conftest.py (backend/tests/unit/llm_security/presets/conftest.py):
    - preset_names: List of available preset names
    - preset_descriptions: Preset descriptions
    - development_preset_data: Development preset structure
    - production_preset_data: Production preset structure
