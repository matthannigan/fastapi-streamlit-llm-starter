Unit tests for security preset retrieval functions.

This test module verifies the core preset retrieval functionality of the
app.infrastructure.security.llm.presets module, focusing on get_preset_config(),
list_presets(), and get_preset_description() functions.

Test Strategy:
    - Component Under Test: app.infrastructure.security.llm.presets (entire module)
    - Testing Approach: Black-box testing through public API only
    - No Mocking: Module has no external dependencies, pure function testing
    - Contract Source: backend/contracts/infrastructure/security/llm/presets.pyi

Fixtures Available:
    From conftest.py (backend/tests/unit/llm_security/presets/conftest.py):
    - preset_names: List of available preset names
    - preset_descriptions: Dictionary of preset descriptions
    - development_preset_data: Expected development preset structure
    - production_preset_data: Expected production preset structure
    - testing_preset_data: Expected testing preset structure
