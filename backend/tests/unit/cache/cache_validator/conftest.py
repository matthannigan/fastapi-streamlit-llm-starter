"""
Test fixtures for cache_validator module unit tests.

This module provides reusable fixtures specific to cache validator testing.
The cache_validator module has no external dependencies requiring mocking,
as it only uses standard library components.

Note: This module exists for consistency with the testing structure,
but currently contains no fixtures as cache_validator has no external dependencies.

# Note: No fixtures needed for cache_validator module as it has no external dependencies.

# which don't require mocking in unit tests following the testing philosophy of mocking
# only at system boundaries.
