Test fixtures for key_generator module unit tests.

This module provides reusable fixtures specific to cache key generation testing.

Note: This module exists for consistency with the testing structure,
but currently contains no fixtures as the key_generator module's dependencies
(CachePerformanceMonitor) are already available in the shared cache conftest.py file.
