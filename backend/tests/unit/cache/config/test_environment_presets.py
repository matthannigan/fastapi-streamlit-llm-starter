Unit tests for EnvironmentPresets and preset system integration.

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
EnvironmentPresets public contract (config.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/testing/TESTING.md.

Coverage Focus:
    - EnvironmentPresets static methods for various environment configurations
    - Preset system integration with new cache preset architecture
    - Preset recommendation logic and environment detection
    - Preset configuration validation and optimization

External Dependencies:
    All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
    the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
