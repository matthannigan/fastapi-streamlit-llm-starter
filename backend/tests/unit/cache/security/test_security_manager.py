"""
Unit tests for RedisCacheSecurityManager secure connection and validation behavior.

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
RedisCacheSecurityManager public contract (security.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/testing/TESTING.md.

Coverage Focus:
    - create_secure_connection() method behavior with various security configurations
    - validate_connection_security() method comprehensive security assessment
    - Security reporting and recommendation generation
    - Connection retry logic and error handling for security failures

External Dependencies:
    All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
    the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.

            And: Status information suitable for monitoring dashboard integration
            And: Security metrics available for alerting and trend analysis

        Security Status Information:
            - Current authentication method and status
            - TLS encryption status and configuration details
            - Certificate validation status and expiration information

            - mock_redis_connection_secure: Connection for status inspection
