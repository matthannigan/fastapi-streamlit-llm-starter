"""
Test fixtures for parameter_mapping module unit tests.

This module provides reusable fixtures specific to cache parameter mapping testing.

Note: This module exists for consistency with the testing structure,
but currently contains no fixtures as the parameter_mapping module's dependencies
(ValidationError, ConfigurationError) are already available in the shared
cache conftest.py file. The ValidationResult is defined within the module itself.

# Note: No additional fixtures needed for parameter_mapping module as its dependencies
# (ValidationError, ConfigurationError) are already available in the shared
# cache conftest.py file. The ValidationResult class is defined within the
# parameter_mapping module itself and doesn't need external mocking.
