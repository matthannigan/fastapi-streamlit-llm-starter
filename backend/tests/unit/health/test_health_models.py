            When: Exception type checking is performed
            Then: HealthCheckTimeoutError is distinguishable
            And: isinstance() correctly identifies timeout errors
            And: Allows specific handling for timeout scenarios

        Test that health check exceptions work with try/except blocks.

        Verifies:
            Exception handling patterns per HealthCheckError Usage examples.

        Business Impact:
            Enables proper error recovery in health monitoring code.

        Scenario:
            Given: Code that may raise HealthCheckError or HealthCheckTimeoutError
            When: Try/except blocks are used for error handling
            Then: Exceptions can be caught and handled appropriately
            And: Specific exception types can be distinguished
            And: Error messages are accessible for logging
