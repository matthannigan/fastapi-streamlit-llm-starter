"""
Unit tests for AIResponseCache refactored implementation.

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
AIResponseCache public contract (redis_ai.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

Test Organization:
    - TestAIResponseCacheInitialization: Constructor and parameter mapping behavior
    - TestAIResponseCacheCoreOperations: Primary cache operations (cache_response, get_cached_response)
    - TestAIResponseCacheInvalidation: Cache invalidation patterns and operations
    - TestAIResponseCacheStatistics: Statistics and performance monitoring behavior
    - TestAIResponseCacheInheritance: Inheritance relationship with GenericRedisCache
    - TestAIResponseCacheErrorHandling: Error scenarios and graceful degradation
    - TestAIResponseCacheConnection: Connection management and graceful degradation

Coverage Focus:
    - Infrastructure service (>90% test coverage requirement)
    - Behavior verification per docstring specifications
    - Error handling and graceful degradation patterns
    - Performance monitoring integration

External Dependencies:
    All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
    the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
