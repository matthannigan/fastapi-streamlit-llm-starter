Test suite for ConfigurationPerformanceBenchmark initialization behavior.

This module verifies the initialization contract of the ConfigurationPerformanceBenchmark
class, ensuring proper setup of benchmark state, result storage, and baseline configuration.

Test Strategy:
    - Verify clean state initialization
    - Verify baseline results initialization
    - Verify logger setup
    - Verify no external dependencies required for initialization

Business Critical:
    Proper initialization ensures benchmark suite starts with clean state and
    can accurately track performance metrics without interference from previous runs.
