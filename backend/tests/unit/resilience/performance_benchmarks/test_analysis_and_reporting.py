            When: generate_performance_report formats the timings
            Then: Sub-millisecond times are displayed with appropriate precision
            And: Fast benchmark performance is accurately represented

        Fixtures Used:
            - None required for fast timing edge case

        Edge Cases Covered:
            - Sub-millisecond timing display
            - Precision preservation for fast operations

        Test that generate_performance_report formats very slow benchmark timings.

        Verifies:
            Report correctly formats and displays benchmarks with execution
            times in seconds or minutes for slow operations.

        Business Impact:
            Accurate slow timing reporting enables identification of operations
            significantly exceeding performance targets.

        Scenario:
            Given: A BenchmarkSuite with 5000ms (5 second) execution times
            When: generate_performance_report formats the timings
            Then: Slow times are displayed in appropriate units (seconds)
            And: Performance issues are clearly visible

        Fixtures Used:
            - None required for slow timing edge case

        Edge Cases Covered:
            - Multi-second timing display
            - Large timing value formatting
