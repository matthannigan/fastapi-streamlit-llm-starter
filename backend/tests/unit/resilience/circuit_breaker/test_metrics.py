Unit tests for ResilienceMetrics dataclass.

Tests verify that ResilienceMetrics provides comprehensive metrics collection,
accurate rate calculations, and monitoring integration capabilities according
to its documented contract.

Test Organization:
    - TestResilienceMetricsInitialization: Metrics creation and initial state
    - TestResilienceMetricsSuccessRate: Success rate calculation accuracy
    - TestResilienceMetricsFailureRate: Failure rate calculation accuracy
    - TestResilienceMetricsToDictExport: Dictionary export for monitoring systems
    - TestResilienceMetricsThreadSafety: Thread-safe operations and state consistency
    - TestResilienceMetricsTimestampTracking: Timestamp recording and temporal analysis

Component Under Test:
    ResilienceMetrics from app.infrastructure.resilience.circuit_breaker

External Dependencies (Mocked):
    None - ResilienceMetrics is a pure dataclass with computed properties

Fixtures Used:
    - fake_datetime: For deterministic timestamp testing (from tests/unit/conftest.py)
