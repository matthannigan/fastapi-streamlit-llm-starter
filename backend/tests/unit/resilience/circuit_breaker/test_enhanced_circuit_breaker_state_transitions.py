"""
Unit tests for EnhancedCircuitBreaker state transitions.

Tests verify that circuit breaker correctly transitions between CLOSED, OPEN, and HALF_OPEN
states according to the documented circuit breaker pattern contract.

Test Organization:
    - TestCircuitBreakerClosedToOpen: Transition from CLOSED to OPEN state
    - TestCircuitBreakerOpenToHalfOpen: Recovery timeout and transition to HALF_OPEN
    - TestCircuitBreakerHalfOpenToClosed: Successful recovery back to CLOSED
    - TestCircuitBreakerHalfOpenToOpen: Failed recovery returning to OPEN
    - TestCircuitBreakerStateChangeLogging: State change notification logging

Component Under Test:
    EnhancedCircuitBreaker state management from app.infrastructure.resilience.circuit_breaker

External Dependencies (Mocked):
    - circuitbreaker.CircuitBreaker: Third-party base circuit breaker state machine
    - logging: For state change notifications
    - datetime: For recovery timeout calculations

Fixtures Used:
    - mock_logger: Mock logger for testing state change logging (from tests/unit/conftest.py)
    - fake_datetime: For deterministic timeout testing (from tests/unit/conftest.py)
    - circuit_breaker_test_data: Standardized test scenarios (from circuit_breaker/conftest.py)
