        - Configuration consistency under various conditions

    Business Critical:
        Robust configuration parsing prevents deployment failures and
        security misconfigurations in production environments.

    Test Strategy:
        - Test invalid environment variable values
        - Test empty and whitespace environment variables
        - Test configuration immutability after initialization

        Test that invalid AUTH_MODE values default to simple mode safely.

        Verifies:
            Invalid AUTH_MODE environment variable values default to simple mode.

        Business Impact:
            Prevents authentication system failures due to misconfigured environment
            variables and ensures safe fallback to basic authentication mode.

            Prevents configuration errors caused by whitespace in environment
            variable values that could occur during deployment automation.

            Given: Environment variables contain leading or trailing whitespace.
