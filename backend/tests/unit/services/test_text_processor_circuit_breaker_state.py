"""Service-level circuit breaker state management tests for TextProcessorService.

This module tests circuit breaker behavior at service level where we have direct
access to circuit breaker state and can properly validate state transitions
without HTTP layer interference or fallback response masking.

Seam Under Test:
    TextProcessorService → AI Resilience Orchestrator → Circuit Breaker → AI Service

Critical Paths:
    - Circuit breaker opens after failure threshold is reached
    - Circuit breaker open state causes fast failures without AI service calls
    - Circuit breaker half-open state tests recovery with successful call
    - Circuit breaker state is accessible and observable at service level

Business Impact:
    - Ensures circuit breaker properly protects AI services during outages
    - Validates fast failure behavior when services are known to be down
    - Confirms automatic recovery when services become available again
    - Provides reliable service degradation and restoration patterns

Test Strategy:
    - Use TextProcessorService directly with mocked AI Agent
    - Control AI service failures to trigger specific circuit breaker states
    - Access circuit breaker state directly through resilience orchestrator
    - Verify state transitions and behavior at service level
    - Test timing behavior for half-open state recovery

Success Criteria:
    - Circuit breaker opens after failure threshold
    - Open circuit breaker causes immediate failures without AI calls
    - Half-open state allows recovery testing with successful calls
    - Circuit breaker state can be accessed and verified directly
    - Service-level resilience behavior matches expected patterns
