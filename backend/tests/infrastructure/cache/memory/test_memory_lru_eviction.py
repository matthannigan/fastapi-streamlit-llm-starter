Unit tests for InMemoryCache LRU eviction and memory management behavior.

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
InMemoryCache public contract (memory.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

Coverage Focus:
    - LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy implementation
    - Memory management and size limit enforcement
    - Access order tracking and eviction decisions
    - Cache size management and statistics

External Dependencies:
    - Settings configuration (mocked): Application configuration management
    - Standard library components (threading, collections): For thread-safe operations and data structures
    - app.core.exceptions: Exception handling for configuration and validation errors
