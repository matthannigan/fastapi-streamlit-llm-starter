"""
Comprehensive test suite for GenericRedisCache callback system integration.

This module provides systematic behavioral testing of the callback system
functionality, ensuring proper event notification, callback registration,
and integration with cache operations.

Test Coverage:
    - Callback registration for various cache events
    - Callback invocation during cache operations
    - Multiple callback handling for single events
    - Error handling in callback execution
    - Callback system integration with performance monitoring
    - Event-driven cache behavior validation

Testing Philosophy:
    - Uses behavior-driven testing with Given/When/Then structure
    - Tests callback system behavior without mocking the core callback mechanism
    - Validates callback timing and data consistency
    - Ensures callback failures don't affect cache operations
    - Comprehensive event coverage for all cache operations

Test Organization:
    - TestCallbackRegistration: Callback registration and management
    - TestCacheEventCallbacks: Event-driven callback invocation testing
    - TestMultipleCallbackHandling: Multiple callback coordination
    - TestCallbackErrorHandling: Error scenarios and resilience

Fixtures and Mocks:
    From conftest.py:
        - default_generic_redis_config: Standard configuration dictionary
        - fakeredis: Stateful fake Redis client
        - sample_callback_functions: Test callback functions with tracking
        - bulk_test_data: Multiple key-value pairs for batch testing
    From parent conftest.py:
        - sample_cache_key: Standard cache key for testing
        - sample_cache_value: Standard cache value for testing
        - sample_ttl: Standard TTL value for testing
