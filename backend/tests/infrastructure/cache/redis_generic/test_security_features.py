"""
Comprehensive test suite for GenericRedisCache security features.

This module provides systematic behavioral testing of the security functionality
including security validation, configuration management, reporting, and testing
capabilities integrated with the GenericRedisCache.

Test Coverage:
    - Security configuration validation and management
    - Security status reporting and recommendations
    - Comprehensive security assessment and reporting
    - Security configuration testing and validation
    - Integration with Redis connection security
    - Error handling for security-related operations

Testing Philosophy:
    - Uses behavior-driven testing with Given/When/Then structure
    - Tests security functionality with realistic mock configurations
    - Validates security integration without compromising test security
    - Ensures graceful degradation when security features are unavailable
    - Comprehensive coverage of security scenarios and edge cases

Test Organization:
    - TestSecurityValidation: Security validation and assessment functionality
    - TestSecurityStatusManagement: Security status reporting and management
    - TestSecurityReporting: Security report generation and formatting
    - TestSecurityConfigurationTesting: Security configuration testing and validation

Fixtures and Mocks:
    From conftest.py:
        - mock_security_config: Mock SecurityConfig with basic authentication
        - mock_tls_security_config: Mock SecurityConfig with TLS encryption
        - secure_generic_redis_config: Configuration with security enabled
        - default_generic_redis_config: Standard configuration for comparison
        - mock_redis_client: Stateful mock Redis client
    From parent conftest.py:
        - sample_cache_key: Standard cache key for testing
        - sample_cache_value: Standard cache value for testing
