class TestCacheMonitoringWorkflow:
    """
    End-to-end test for the cache monitoring and observability workflow.
    
    Scope:
        Verifies that actions performed via the cache management API are
        correctly reflected in the monitoring and metrics endpoints.
        
    Business Critical:
        Monitoring and metrics are essential for operational visibility,
        capacity planning, and incident response in production environments.
        
    Test Strategy:
        - End-to-end workflow testing from operations to metrics
        - Error handling validation for monitoring endpoints
        - Performance and consistency testing under various load conditions
        - Complete metrics structure validation
        
    External Dependencies:
        - Uses authenticated_client fixture for API access
        - Requires cleanup_test_cache fixture for test isolation
        - Assumes proper cache infrastructure configuration
        
    Known Limitations:
        - Load testing is simulated and may not reflect production volumes
        - Timing-based tests may be sensitive to system performance
        - Does not test actual Redis/memory cache backends directly

        """
        Test that an invalidation action is reflected in the metrics and stats endpoints.

        Test Purpose:
            This test ensures the monitoring and metrics systems are correctly integrated
            with the cache's operational endpoints. It validates the end-to-end observability
            of the cache management service.

        Business Impact:
            Accurate metrics are critical for operational health monitoring, capacity
            planning, and identifying optimization opportunities. This test provides
            confidence that our monitoring data is reliable.

        Test Scenario:
            1.  GIVEN the cache service is running.
            2.  WHEN an administrator performs a cache invalidation.
            3.  THEN the invalidation statistics and performance metrics should
                be updated to reflect this specific action.

            - The `POST /internal/cache/invalidate` request succeeds with a 200 status code.
            - The response message confirms the correct invalidation pattern.
            - The `GET /internal/cache/invalidation-stats` endpoint shows updated frequency data.
            - The `GET /internal/cache/metrics` endpoint's total operations count increases.
