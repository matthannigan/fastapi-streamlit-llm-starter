class TestCacheMonitoringWorkflow:
    """
    End-to-end test for the cache monitoring and observability workflow.
    
    Scope:
        Verifies that actions performed via the cache management API are
        correctly reflected in the monitoring and metrics endpoints.
        
    Business Critical:
        Monitoring and metrics are essential for operational visibility,
        capacity planning, and incident response in production environments.
        
    Test Strategy:
        - End-to-end workflow testing from operations to metrics
        - Error handling validation for monitoring endpoints
        - Performance and consistency testing under various load conditions
        - Complete metrics structure validation
        
    External Dependencies:
        - Uses authenticated_client fixture for API access
        - Requires cleanup_test_cache fixture for test isolation
        - Assumes proper cache infrastructure configuration
        
    Known Limitations:
        - Load testing is simulated and may not reflect production volumes
        - Timing-based tests may be sensitive to system performance
        - Does not test actual Redis/memory cache backends directly

        Test that an invalidation action is reflected in the metrics and stats endpoints.

        Test Purpose:
            This test ensures the monitoring and metrics systems are correctly integrated
            with the cache's operational endpoints. It validates the end-to-end observability
            of the cache management service.

        Business Impact:
            Accurate metrics are critical for operational health monitoring, capacity
            planning, and identifying optimization opportunities. This test provides
            confidence that our monitoring data is reliable.

                be updated to reflect this specific action.

            - The response message confirms the correct invalidation pattern.
            - The `GET /internal/cache/invalidation-stats` endpoint shows updated frequency data.
            - The `GET /internal/cache/metrics` endpoint's total operations count increases.
