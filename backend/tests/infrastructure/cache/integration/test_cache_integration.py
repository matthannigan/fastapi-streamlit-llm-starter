"""
Integration tests for cache infrastructure components.

This test suite verifies cross-component interactions using real implementations
instead of extensive mocking. Tests demonstrate how different cache components
work together to provide complete functionality.

Coverage Focus:
    - Factory + Cache + Monitor integration
    - Settings + Factory integration  
    - Cache + Key Generator + Performance Monitor integration
    - End-to-end cache workflows with real components

External Dependencies:
    Uses real components with graceful degradation for Redis unavailability.
    No internal mocking - only system boundary mocking where necessary.
