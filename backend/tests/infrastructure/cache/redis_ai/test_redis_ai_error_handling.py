"""
Unit tests for AIResponseCache error handling and resilience behavior.

This test suite verifies the observable error handling behaviors documented in the
AIResponseCache public contract. Tests focus on behavior-driven testing principles
described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

Coverage Focus:
    - Error handling and graceful degradation patterns
    - Parameter validation with detailed error context  
    - Infrastructure failure resilience
    - Performance monitoring integration during errors

Implementation Notes:
    - Tests focus on observable behavior rather than implementation details
    - Infrastructure tests verify actual error conditions rather than mocking internal components
    - Parameter validation tests are based on observed behavior of the key generation system
    - Some integration-level tests are skipped in favor of proper integration test coverage

Error Handling Philosophy:
    - Infrastructure errors should provide meaningful context for debugging
    - Parameter validation should give clear feedback for fixing issues
    - Performance monitoring should continue during error conditions
    - Cache operations should degrade gracefully without breaking domain services

External Dependencies:
    All external dependencies are real components where possible, following
    the behavior-driven testing approach of testing actual observable outcomes.
