            - Measures memory usage before benchmark execution starts
            - Tracks memory usage after benchmark execution completes
            - Calculates memory deltas to identify benchmark-specific impact
            - Records peak memory consumption during execution
            - Includes memory metrics in final benchmark results
            
        Memory Metrics Validation:
            - Memory delta reflects memory usage change during benchmark
            - Peak memory captures highest memory consumption point
            - Memory tracking handles measurement failures gracefully
            - Memory data is included in BenchmarkResult for analysis
            
        Memory Tracking Integration:
            - Memory measurements don't significantly impact benchmark timing
            - Memory tracking works across different platform environments
            - Failed memory measurements don't terminate benchmark execution
            - Memory data supports regression detection and comparison analysis

        Business Impact:
            Delivers detailed performance analysis including percentiles, outlier
            detection, and variability assessment for accurate performance evaluation
            
        Scenario:
            Given: Cache operation timing data from benchmark execution
            When: Statistical analysis is performed on timing measurements
            Then: Comprehensive statistics are calculated and included in results
            
        Statistical Analysis Components:
            - Percentile calculations (P95, P99) for tail latency analysis
            - Standard deviation calculation for performance variability assessment  
            - Outlier detection using Interquartile Range (IQR) method
            - Confidence interval calculation for statistical significance
            - Mean, median, min, max calculation for complete distribution analysis
            
        Statistical Metrics Integration:
            - All statistical metrics are included in BenchmarkResult
            - Outlier detection improves statistical accuracy
            - Statistics handle non-finite values (infinity, NaN) gracefully
            - Statistical analysis supports performance grading and comparison
            
        Performance Insight Generation:
            - Percentiles identify tail latency performance characteristics
            - Standard deviation indicates performance consistency
            - Outliers are identified and can be excluded from analysis
            - Comprehensive statistics support regression detection

        Verify benchmark execution respects timeout configuration to prevent indefinite hanging.
        
        Business Impact:
            Ensures benchmark execution completes within expected timeframes
            in automated environments, preventing CI/CD pipeline delays
            
        Scenario:
            Given: Benchmark configuration with specific timeout value
            When: Benchmark execution approaches or exceeds timeout duration
            Then: Benchmark terminates gracefully with appropriate error handling
            
        Timeout Behavior Requirements:
            - Benchmark monitors total execution time against configured timeout
            - Timeout prevents indefinite execution in automated environments
            - Graceful termination provides partial results when possible
            - Timeout errors are clearly identified in results or exceptions
            
        Timeout Configuration Testing:
            - Short timeout values terminate long-running benchmarks appropriately
            - Reasonable timeout values allow normal benchmark completion
            - Zero or negative timeout values are handled appropriately
            - Timeout enforcement doesn't corrupt measurement accuracy
            
        Note: Current implementation focuses on operation-level timeouts
        through individual cache operation behavior rather than overall benchmark timeout.
        This test verifies timeout-aware benchmark design principles.
