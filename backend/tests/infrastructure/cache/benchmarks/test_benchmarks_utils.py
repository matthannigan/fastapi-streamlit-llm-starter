        Verify track_peak_memory() accurately identifies peak memory usage from measurement series.
        
        Business Impact:
            Identifies maximum memory consumption during benchmark execution,
            supporting capacity planning and memory pressure analysis
            
        Scenario:
            Given: Series of memory measurements during benchmark execution
            When: track_peak_memory() is called with measurement series
            Then: Peak values are identified accurately for all memory metrics
            
        Peak Tracking Features:
            - Peak process memory: Maximum process memory usage observed
            - Peak system metrics: Maximum values for available memory, utilization
            - Multi-metric tracking: Peaks calculated for all available metrics
            - Measurement series analysis: Processes complete measurement history
            
        Peak Identification:
            - Maximum value found for each metric across all measurements
            - Missing values handled gracefully (excluded from peak calculation)
            - Non-numeric values filtered out before peak calculation
            - Peak calculations work with partial data availability
            
        Memory Analysis Applications:
            - Peak memory supports capacity planning decisions
            - Memory pressure identification during benchmark execution
            - Resource requirement estimation for deployment
            - Memory efficiency comparison across implementations
            
        Edge Case Handling:
            - Empty measurement series: Returns empty peaks dictionary
            - Single measurement: Returns values from that measurement as peaks
            - Mixed metric availability: Calculates peaks for available metrics only
            - Invalid values: Filtered out appropriately without affecting results

        Verify memory tracking methods handle measurement failures without interrupting benchmarks.
        
        Business Impact:
            Ensures benchmark execution continues even when memory measurement
            fails, maintaining performance analysis capability under adverse conditions
            
        Scenario:
            Given: Conditions causing memory measurement failures
            When: Memory tracking methods are called during failures
            Then: Methods handle failures gracefully and return sensible defaults
            
        Failure Scenarios:
            - psutil import failures in restricted environments
            - /proc filesystem access failures on Linux systems
            - Permission denied errors during memory measurement
            - System resource exhaustion preventing measurement
            
        Graceful Failure Handling:
            - ImportError from missing psutil: Falls back to alternative methods
            - IOError from file access: Returns default values
            - PermissionError from restricted access: Logs error and continues
            - Other exceptions: Caught and logged without interrupting execution
            
        Resilient Operation:
            - Benchmark execution continues despite measurement failures
            - Partial memory data provided when possible
            - Default values returned when measurement impossible
            - Error logging provides debugging information without crashing
            
        Default Value Behavior:
            - Process memory defaults to 0.0 MB when measurement fails
            - System memory fields default to 0.0 when unavailable
            - Delta calculations handle default values appropriately
            - Peak tracking works with partial or missing measurement data

        Business Impact:
            Ensures consistent memory reporting across all tracking methods,

        Unit Conversion Requirements:
            - psutil RSS values: Converted from bytes to megabytes (/ 1024 / 1024)
            - /proc VmRSS values: Converted from kilobytes to megabytes (/ 1024)
            - System memory values: Converted from bytes to megabytes
            - All output values in MB for consistent analysis
            
        Conversion Accuracy:
            - Byte to megabyte: value / (1024 * 1024)
            - Kilobyte to megabyte: value / 1024
            - Precision maintained appropriately for analysis needs
            - Consistent conversion factors across all methods
            
        Consistency Verification:
            - All memory tracking methods return MB values
            - Delta calculations work with consistent units
            - Peak tracking compares values in same units
