"""
Unit tests for performance monitoring metric dataclasses.

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
monitoring metric dataclasses (monitoring.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

Coverage Focus:
    - Dataclass initialization and post-initialization validation
    - Data structure integrity and field validation
    - Type safety and value constraint enforcement
    - Performance metric data representation accuracy

External Dependencies:
    No external dependencies - testing pure dataclass functionality and validation.
