"""
Unit tests for CacheConfigBuilder fluent interface and configuration building.

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
CacheConfigBuilder public contract (config.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

Coverage Focus:
    - CacheConfigBuilder fluent interface and method chaining
    - Environment-based configuration loading and file operations
    - Validation integration and error handling during building
    - Configuration building and finalization through build() method

External Dependencies:
    All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
    the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
