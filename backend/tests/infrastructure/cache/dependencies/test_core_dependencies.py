"""
Unit tests for core cache dependency functions.

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
cache dependencies public contract (dependencies.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

Coverage Focus:
    - get_settings() cached settings dependency behavior
    - get_cache_config() configuration building from settings
    - get_cache_service() main cache service dependency with registry management
    - Dependency integration and error handling

External Dependencies:
    - Settings configuration (mocked): Application configuration management
    - Standard library components (lru_cache): For function caching and performance optimization
    - Redis client library (fakeredis): Redis connection simulation for cache service creation
