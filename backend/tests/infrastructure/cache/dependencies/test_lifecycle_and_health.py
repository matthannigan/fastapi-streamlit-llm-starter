"""
Unit tests for cache dependency lifecycle management and health monitoring.

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
cache dependencies public contract (dependencies.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/testing/TESTING.md.

Coverage Focus:
    - CacheDependencyManager registry cleanup and lifecycle management
    - cleanup_cache_registry() function behavior and resource management  
    - get_cache_health_status() health monitoring and ping() method support
    - validate_cache_configuration() validation dependency behavior

External Dependencies:
    All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
    the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
