"""
Unit tests for cache dependency lifecycle management and health monitoring.

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
cache dependencies public contract (dependencies.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

Coverage Focus:
    - CacheDependencyManager registry cleanup and lifecycle management
    - cleanup_cache_registry() function behavior and resource management  
    - get_cache_health_status() health monitoring and ping() method support
    - validate_cache_configuration() validation dependency behavior

External Dependencies:
    All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
    the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.

            Configuration validation errors are converted to proper HTTP error responses
            
        Business Impact:
            Provides clear HTTP error responses for invalid cache configurations
            
        Scenario:
            Given: Invalid CacheConfig with validation errors
            When: validate_cache_configuration() validates invalid configuration
            Then: ValidationError is caught and converted to HTTPException
            And: HTTP 500 status code returned for configuration validation failure
            And: Error details included in HTTP response for troubleshooting
            
        HTTP Error Conversion Verified:
            - ValidationError caught during configuration validation
            - HTTPException raised with HTTP 500 status for configuration errors
            - Error details from validation included in HTTP response
            - HTTP error response format suitable for API error handling
            - Configuration validation prevents invalid config exposure via HTTP
            
        Fixtures Used:
            - Invalid configuration for validation error testing
            - mock_fastapi_http_exception: HTTPException for error conversion testing
            
        API Error Handling:
            Configuration validation provides proper HTTP error responses for invalid configs

        Business Impact:
            Enables configuration validation as FastAPI dependency for endpoint protection
            
        Scenario:
            Given: FastAPI endpoint using validate_cache_configuration as dependency
            When: Endpoint is accessed and dependency validation occurs

            And: Invalid configurations result in HTTP error responses
            
        FastAPI Integration Verified:
            - validate_cache_configuration works as FastAPI Depends() dependency
            - Dependency resolution occurs correctly before endpoint execution
            - Valid configurations passed to endpoint functions successfully
            - HTTP error responses generated for invalid configurations
            - Dependency integration provides endpoint-level configuration protection
            
        Fixtures Used:
