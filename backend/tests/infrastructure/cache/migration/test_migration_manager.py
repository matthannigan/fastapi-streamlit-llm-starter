"""
Unit tests for CacheMigrationManager cache migration orchestration.

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
CacheMigrationManager public contract (migration.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

Coverage Focus:
    - Infrastructure service (>90% test coverage requirement)
    - Behavior verification per docstring specifications
    - Migration orchestration and data integrity
    - Performance monitoring and progress tracking

External Dependencies:
    All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
    the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
