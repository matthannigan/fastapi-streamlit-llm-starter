Unit tests for CacheMigrationManager validation operations.

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
CacheMigrationManager validation methods (migration.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/testing/TESTING.md.

Coverage Focus:
    - Data consistency validation between cache implementations
    - Comprehensive validation statistics and reporting
    - Sample-based validation for large datasets
    - Performance optimization during validation operations

External Dependencies:
    All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
    the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
