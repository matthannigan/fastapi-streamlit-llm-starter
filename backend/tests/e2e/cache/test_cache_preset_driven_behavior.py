    """
    End-to-end test for verifying configuration-driven behavior via presets.
    
    Scope:
        Validates that the `CACHE_PRESET` environment variable correctly alters
        the running state and observable behavior of the cache service.
        
    External Dependencies:
        - Uses client_with_preset fixture for environment isolation
        - Assumes proper Redis/memory cache configuration
        
    Known Limitations:
        - Does not test actual Redis connectivity (uses mocked connections)
        - Preset transitions tested via app factory, not live server restarts
        - Performance impact of preset changes not measured

        Test that different cache presets result in different observable statuses.

        Test Purpose:
            To verify that the application's configuration system works end-to-end,
            from an environment variable setting to a change in API behavior.

        Business Impact:
            Provides confidence that we can reliably configure our application for
            different environments (development, production, disabled) and that these
            configurations are being correctly applied, which is critical for performance,
            stability, and cost management.

        Test Scenario:
            1.  GIVEN the application is configured with a specific CACHE_PRESET.
            2.  WHEN a request is made to `GET /internal/cache/status`.
            3.  THEN the response should indicate the expected Redis and memory status
                according to the preset configuration.

        Success Criteria:
            - Each preset returns expected Redis connection status
            - Each preset returns expected memory cache status  
            - Status endpoint responds gracefully with 200 for all presets
            - Response structure contains required status fields
