# Integration Tests Seams Manifest TODOs

## Immediate Action Items

1. Add depends_on field to 3-5 key PLANNED seams to demonstrate value
2. Add coverage_aspects to IMPLEMENTED cache and auth tests
3. Add business_value to P0 PLANNED tests

## 1. Add Cross-References and Dependencies

Add fields to track relationships between seams:

```yaml
- id: resilience-textproc-integration
  description: Core user-facing functionality with resilience protection
  status: PLANNED
  components:
    - TextProcessorService
    - AIServiceResilience decorators

  # NEW: Track what this seam depends on
  depends_on:
    - resilience-api-circuit-breaker  # Requires circuit breaker implementation
    - cache-factory-integration       # Uses cache infrastructure

  # NEW: Track what depends on this seam
  depended_by:
    - textproc-cache-failure-resilience  # Builds on this integration

  # NEW: Related unit tests for reference
  related_unit_tests:
    - tests/unit/services/test_text_processor.py
    - tests/unit/infrastructure/resilience/test_orchestrator.py

  # NEW: Related seams testing similar concerns
  related_seams:
    - textproc-api-cache-performance  # Also tests TextProcessor
    - resilience-library-integration   # Also tests circuit breaker
```

## 2. Add Test Characteristics Metadata

Add fields to help understand test complexity and maintenance burden:

```yaml
- id: cache-encryption-pipeline
  description: Complete encryption pipeline with JSON serialization
  status: IMPLEMENTED

  # NEW: Test characteristics
  characteristics:
    execution_time: "fast"        # fast/medium/slow
    complexity: "medium"          # low/medium/high
    maintenance_burden: "low"     # low/medium/high
    flakiness_risk: "none"        # none/low/medium/high
    requires_docker: false
    requires_redis: true
    requires_external_api: false

  # NEW: Test metrics (populated after implementation)
  metrics:
    avg_duration_ms: 45
    last_run: "2025-10-21"
    failure_count_30d: 0
    lines_of_code: 120
```

## 3. Add Coverage Tracking

Add a field to track what aspects of components are tested:

```yaml
- id: cache-factory-integration
  description: Cache factory assembly with settings configuration
  status: IMPLEMENTED

  # NEW: What aspects are covered by this test
  coverage_aspects:
    - "Factory creates correct cache type based on preset"
    - "Settings integration with cache configuration"
    - "Graceful degradation to in-memory cache"
    - "GenericRedisCache vs AIResponseCache selection"

  # NEW: What aspects are NOT covered (opportunities for new tests)
  coverage_gaps:
    - "Thread safety of factory under concurrent access"
    - "Cache pool management and connection limits"
```

## 4. Add Business Value / User Impact

Clarify why each test matters for prioritization:

```yaml
- id: textproc-api-cache-performance
  description: Reduces AI API costs through caching
  status: PLANNED
  priority: P0

  # NEW: Business value explanation
  business_value:
    user_impact: "Critical - directly affects API response time and costs"
    failure_scenario: "Without cache, every request hits expensive AI API"
    sla_impact: "Affects p95 latency and monthly API costs"
    production_incidents: 0  # Track if this caused prod issues
```

## 5. Add Implementation Guidance

For PLANNED tests, add implementation hints:

```yaml
- id: resilience-api-circuit-breaker
  description: Circuit breaker integration
  status: PLANNED
  priority: P0

  # NEW: Implementation guidance
  implementation:
    estimated_effort: "4 hours"
    prerequisite_reading:
      - docs/guides/infrastructure/RESILIENCE.md
      - backend/tests/integration/resilience/TEST_PLAN.md
    fixture_requirements:
      - mock_ai_service
      - circuit_breaker_config
    key_assertions:
      - "Circuit opens after threshold failures"
      - "Circuit half-opens after timeout"
      - "Metrics are collected correctly"
```

## 6. Add Pre-Implementation Checklist

For each PLANNED seam, add a checklist in comments:

```yaml
- id: resilience-textproc-integration
  status: PLANNED
  priority: P0

  # Pre-implementation checklist:
  # □ Review depends_on seams are implemented
  # □ Review related_seams for patterns to reuse
  # □ Check coverage_gaps in related seams
  # □ Read prerequisite documentation
  # □ Verify test fixtures are available
  # □ Ensure mock dependencies exist
  # □ Check if similar patterns exist elsewhere
```
