"""
Integration tests for Compression Middleware → Content-Type/Size Integration.

This module tests the intelligent compression behavior across the middleware stack,
focusing on content-aware decisions, algorithm selection, size thresholds, and
response headers. Tests validate observable HTTP behavior at the application
boundary, ensuring compression optimizes bandwidth while maintaining performance.

Critical Integration Path:
    Request → CompressionMiddleware → Content-Type/Size Evaluation → Algorithm Selection
    → Response Compression → Headers Management → Client Response

Business Impact:
    Performance optimization for bandwidth usage and response times.
    Incorrect Content-Length breaks HTTP clients; missing compression wastes bandwidth;
    over-compression of already compressed content wastes CPU cycles.

Testing Philosophy:
    - Test through HTTP boundary using TestClient
    - Verify observable behavior (headers, response size, status codes)
    - Use high-fidelity test data (different content types and sizes)
    - Validate compression effectiveness and proper header management
    - No mocking of compression internals - test actual middleware behavior

    Integration tests for CompressionMiddleware → Content-Type/Size Integration.

    Seam Under Test:
        CompressionMiddleware (orchestrator) → Content-Type detection → Size threshold
        validation → Algorithm selection → Response compression → Header management

    Critical Paths:
        - Path 1: Content-Type-based compression decisions for optimal bandwidth usage
        - Path 2: Algorithm negotiation based on client Accept-Encoding preferences
        - Path 3: Size threshold validation to avoid compressing small responses
        - Path 4: Compression headers and content integrity for client compatibility

    Business Impact:
        Performance optimization through intelligent compression decisions.
        Reduces bandwidth costs and improves response times for clients.
        Prevents CPU waste on already compressed content and ensures proper HTTP semantics.

    Integration Scope:
        - CompressionMiddleware with real compression algorithms
        - Content-Type detection and compressibility evaluation
        - Size threshold enforcement (default: 1KB minimum)
        - Algorithm selection based on Accept-Encoding header
        - Response header management (Content-Encoding, Content-Length, metadata)
        - Request decompression handling
