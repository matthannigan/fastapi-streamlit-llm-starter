"""
Integration tests for Logging Middleware → Sensitive Data Redaction Integration (Security).

This module tests the critical security seam between RequestLoggingMiddleware and
sensitive data redaction capabilities, focusing on query parameter filtering,
header filtering, request/response body filtering, and correlation ID maintenance.
These tests validate security compliance and protection against credential leakage
in logs while preserving debugging capabilities.

Seam Under Test:
    RequestLoggingMiddleware (log generation and filtering)
    → Sensitive data redaction in logs
    → Query parameter filtering
    → Header filtering
    → Request/response body filtering
    → Correlation ID maintenance

Critical Paths:
    - Query parameter redaction: Request with sensitive query params (?api_key=secret, ?password=hidden, ?token=value)
    - Header redaction: Request with sensitive headers (Authorization, X-API-Key, Cookie)
    - Request body redaction: POST request with JSON containing sensitive fields
    - Response body redaction: Response containing sensitive data
    - Non-sensitive data preservation: Correlation IDs and debugging information maintained

Business Impact:
    Security compliance. Logging without redaction creates security vulnerabilities
    and compliance violations. Sensitive data must be filtered while maintaining
    debugging capabilities.

Test Strategy:
    - Test through HTTP boundary using TestClient with full middleware stack
    - Verify observable behavior in logs (using caplog fixture) not internal implementation
    - Test all sensitive data types: headers, query params, request bodies, response bodies
    - Validate that correlation IDs and non-sensitive data are preserved
    - Use high-fidelity fixtures over mocks for realistic testing
