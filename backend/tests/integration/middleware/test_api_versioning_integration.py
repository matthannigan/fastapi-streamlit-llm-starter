"""
Integration tests for API Versioning → Internal API Bypass Integration.

This module tests the critical integration seam between API versioning middleware
and internal API routing protection. It validates that the middleware correctly
detects API versions using multiple strategies while safely bypassing versioning
for internal API routes to prevent unintended path rewrites.

Seam Under Test:
    APIVersioningMiddleware → Internal API Bypass Logic → Version Detection Strategies → Path Rewriting

Critical Paths:
    - Internal API bypass: Requests to /internal/* routes skip version detection and path rewriting
    - Multi-strategy version detection: Path, header, query, and Accept header detection with priority
    - Version validation: Supported versions proceed, unsupported versions return structured errors
    - Response headers: All responses include comprehensive version information headers
    - Path rewriting: Version detection triggers appropriate path rewriting for routing

Business Impact:
    API evolution + internal API protection. Correct version detection enables
    backward compatibility and gradual migration. Internal bypass prevents accidental
    version pollution of admin endpoints. Proper headers guide client migration.
    Path rewriting bugs break routing; missing bypass breaks internal endpoints.

Test Strategy:
    - Test internal API bypass with various internal routes
    - Test all version detection strategies individually and with priority
    - Test error handling for unsupported versions with helpful headers
    - Test version headers in responses for all scenarios
    - Test path rewriting behavior for different detection methods

Success Criteria:
    Internal API routes bypass versioning correctly, version detection works across
    all strategies with proper priority, proper version headers in responses,
    graceful handling of invalid versions, correct path rewriting.

        Test that version headers enable clients to implement compatibility features.

        Integration Scope:
            APIVersioningMiddleware → Client Compatibility Headers → Response Headers

        Business Impact:
            Enables clients to build sophisticated version-aware applications.
            Supports automated version handling and migration logic.

        Test Strategy:
            - Test all required compatibility headers are present
            - Verify header formats are client-friendly
            - Test header content enables client decision making
            - Verify consistency across different detection methods

        Success Criteria:
            - All compatibility headers present and properly formatted
            - Header content enables client decision making
            - Consistent behavior across version detection methods
