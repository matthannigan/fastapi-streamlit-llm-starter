"""
Integration tests for Request Logging → Performance Monitoring middleware integration.

This module tests the critical seam between RequestLoggingMiddleware and PerformanceMonitoringMiddleware,
focusing on correlation ID propagation via contextvars, timing coordination, and proper context isolation
under concurrent load. These tests validate the distributed tracing foundation and performance
tracking accuracy that are essential for debugging multi-service requests.

Seam Under Test:
    RequestLoggingMiddleware → PerformanceMonitoringMiddleware → Response Headers & Logs

Critical Paths:
    - Correlation ID generation and contextvar propagation
    - Request duration tracking with millisecond precision
    - Contextvar isolation under concurrent request handling
    - Sensitive data redaction without breaking tracing

Business Impact:
    - Foundation for distributed tracing across services
    - Performance monitoring accuracy for observability
    - Security compliance through sensitive data protection
    - Debugging capability for production incidents

Test Strategy:
    - Test through HTTP boundary using TestClient with full middleware stack
    - Verify observable behavior (headers, logs, timing) not internal implementation
    - Use high-fidelity fixtures (async client, log capture) over mocks
    - Validate both successful and error request scenarios

    Integration tests for Request Logging → Performance Monitoring middleware seam.

        → Concurrent request handling with proper context isolation

    Critical Paths:
        - Correlation ID propagation: Request without existing X-Request-ID, logging middleware generates
          unique UUID, performance middleware captures same correlation ID
        - Request duration tracking: Performance middleware measures request processing time with
          millisecond precision, timing doesn't interfere with request processing
        - Contextvar isolation under concurrency: Multiple concurrent requests get unique correlation
          IDs, performance timing isolated per request, no context bleeding between requests
        - Sensitive data redaction integration: Request with sensitive query params, logs redact
          sensitive values, correlation ID still logged for debugging

    Business Impact:

        Integration Scope:
            - Memory delta tracking via performance monitoring middleware
            - Performance monitoring captures memory changes per request
            - Memory tracking works independently of other middleware
            - Memory metrics included in performance headers

        Business Impact:
            Memory tracking enables identification of memory leaks and performance issues
            at the request level. Essential for production monitoring and capacity planning.

        Test Strategy:
            - Make request and verify memory tracking if enabled
            - Check memory delta header presence and format
            - Validate memory tracking works with performance timing
            - Test multiple requests for memory tracking consistency
