"""
Integration tests for Rate Limiting → Redis/Local Fallback Integration.

Seam Under Test:
    RateLimitMiddleware → RedisRateLimiter/LocalRateLimiter → Redis Infrastructure

Critical Paths:
    - Redis-backed rate limiting: Client identification → Redis counter → Rate limit check → Headers
    - Local fallback behavior: Redis failure → LocalRateLimiter → Graceful degradation
    - Client identification hierarchy: API key → User ID → IP address → Per-client limits
    - Distributed coordination: Multiple clients sharing Redis state

Business Impact:
    DoS protection and abuse prevention for API availability. Rate limiting protects
    against resource exhaustion and coordinated attacks. Graceful degradation ensures
    continued protection during Redis outages. Proper client identification prevents
    rate limit bypass and ensures fair resource allocation.

Test Strategy:
    - Use fakeredis for high-fidelity Redis simulation without network overhead
    - Test both Redis and local fallback code paths for resilience
    - Validate client identification hierarchy with different authentication methods
    - Verify distributed rate limiting behavior across multiple clients
    - Test rate limit headers and retry logic for client integration
    - Simulate Redis failures to validate graceful degradation

Success Criteria:
    Rate limiting works with Redis for distributed scenarios, graceful fallback to
    local limits when Redis unavailable, proper client identification and per-client
    rate limiting, accurate rate limit headers and retry information.
