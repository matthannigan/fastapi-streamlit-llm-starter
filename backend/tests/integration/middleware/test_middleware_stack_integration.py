"""
Integration tests for complete middleware stack execution order (LIFO validation).

This test suite validates the critical architectural pattern of middleware execution
order to ensure proper request processing flow and dependency establishment.

Seam Under Test:
    setup_enhanced_middleware() → All middleware components in LIFO order

Critical Paths:
    - Full Stack Integration: Request → Complete middleware stack → Response with all headers
    - Middleware Dependencies: Logging → Performance → Security → Versioning dependencies
    - Error Propagation: Exception in endpoint → Global handler → Structured error response

Business Impact:
    Validates core architectural pattern (LIFO execution order). Middleware stack
    misconfiguration can break all requests or create security vulnerabilities.

Test Strategy:
    - Test successful request processing through complete stack
    - Verify middleware dependencies are established in correct order
    - Test error scenarios to ensure proper propagation through stack
    - Validate all expected headers are present from each middleware

Success Criteria:
    - All middleware execute in correct LIFO order
    - Dependencies established properly (logging sets request_id before security uses it)
    - Error propagation includes all headers and structured responses
    - Each middleware contributes expected headers to response
