"""
Integration tests for Middleware Configuration → Settings Integration (Feature Toggles).

This module tests the critical integration seam between Settings configuration and
middleware feature toggle behavior. It validates that configuration changes properly
affect middleware registration, behavior, and validation.

Seam Under Test:
    Settings Configuration → Middleware Initialization → Feature Toggle Application → Middleware Behavior

Critical Paths:
    - Feature toggle configuration: Enable/disable middleware via settings
    - Environment-based configuration: Different configs for dev/prod/test environments
    - Configuration validation: Detect and warn about invalid settings
    - Settings integration: Verify settings flow to middleware behavior

Business Impact:
    Configuration errors can disable security features or break functionality.
    Feature toggles enable gradual rollout and quick problem resolution.
    Configuration validation prevents misconfigurations that could cause security vulnerabilities.

Test Strategy:
    - Use create_settings() and create_app(settings_obj=...) pattern for configuration testing
    - Test middleware behavior via HTTP requests, not just presence checks
    - Validate both feature enable/disable and configuration validation scenarios
    - Use environment variables to test environment-specific configuration

Success Criteria:
    - Middleware registration respects settings configuration
    - Invalid configurations handled gracefully with appropriate warnings
    - Environment variables properly affect middleware behavior
    - Feature toggles properly enable/disable middleware components
