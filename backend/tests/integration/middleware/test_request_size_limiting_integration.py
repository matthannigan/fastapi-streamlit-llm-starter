"""
Integration tests for Request Size Limiting → DoS Protection Integration (Streaming Validation).

Seam Under Test:
    RequestSizeLimitMiddleware (streaming size validation) → Content-Length header validation
    → Streaming request processing → Large payload handling → DoS protection through size limits

Critical Paths:
    - Content-Length validation path: Early rejection before body processing
    - Streaming validation path: Real-time size monitoring during chunked requests
    - Per-content-type enforcement: Different limits for JSON, multipart, binary
    - Configuration-driven limits: Environment-based size limit configuration

Business Impact:
    DoS protection prevents memory exhaustion attacks and resource starvation.
    Streaming validation prevents buffering large requests in memory.
    Content-Length validation provides early rejection to save resources.
    Per-content-type limits balance security with usability for different upload scenarios.

Test Strategy:
    - Content-Length header validation: Test early rejection scenarios
    - Streaming size enforcement: Use large_payload_generator for memory-efficient testing
    - Different content types: Validate JSON, form data, and file upload limits
    - Size limit configuration: Test default and custom limit configurations

Success Criteria:
    - Large requests rejected with 413 status code
    - Content-Length validation provides early rejection without body processing
    - Streaming validation prevents memory exhaustion during chunked uploads
    - Per-content-type limits enforce appropriate boundaries
    - Error responses include detailed size limit information
