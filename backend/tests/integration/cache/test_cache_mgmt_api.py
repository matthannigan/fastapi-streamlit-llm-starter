"""
Cache Management API Integration Test Demonstration.

This test suite demonstrates the "Shared Contract Tests" pattern and end-to-end 
testing approach for the Cache Management API. It showcases the key concepts 
for testing complete HTTP-to-cache workflows.

Key Testing Patterns Demonstrated:
    1. End-to-end API testing combining HTTP and direct cache access
    2. Cache invalidation workflow validation  
    3. Metrics accuracy verification after known operations
    4. Complete infrastructure stack testing

Integration Testing Philosophy:
    - Test entire stack from HTTP request to cache backend
    - Validate API contracts and response structures  
    - Verify actual cache state changes through API operations
    - Ensure monitoring metrics reflect real cache operations

This demonstrates the approach suggested in the user's request for testing
the cache's management API as a critical part of the cache's public contract.

        Demonstration of Cache Management API integration testing approach.

        This test showcases the key patterns for testing cache management APIs
        that provide comprehensive validation of the entire infrastructure stack.

        PATTERN 1: Cache Invalidation via API
        ====================================
        Test workflow that demonstrates end-to-end invalidation testing:

        1. Use programmatic interface to set cache values with specific pattern:
           await cache.set("test:invalidate:123", {"data": "test"})

        2. Use HTTP client to POST /internal/cache/invalidate with pattern:
           response = client.post("/internal/cache/invalidate",
                                params={"pattern": "test:invalidate:*"},
                                headers={"X-API-Key": "test-key"})

        3. Verify via programmatic access that keys are gone:
           assert await cache.get("test:invalidate:123") is None

        This verifies the entire invalidation workflow from API to backend.

        PATTERN 2: Metrics Reporting Accuracy
        =====================================
        Test workflow for comprehensive metrics validation:

        1. Perform known cache operations programmatically:
           - 10 cache set operations
           - 5 cache hits (get existing keys)
           - 3 cache misses (get non-existent keys)

        2. Request metrics via HTTP API:
           response = client.get("/internal/cache/metrics")
           metrics = response.json()

        3. Verify metrics accurately reflect operations:
           assert metrics["cache_hits"] >= 5
           assert metrics["cache_misses"] >= 3
           assert metrics["total_cache_operations"] >= 8

        This provides extremely high confidence that monitoring infrastructure
        works correctly from end to end.

        PATTERN 3: Status API Contract Validation
        =========================================
        Test comprehensive infrastructure status reporting:

        1. Request status via HTTP API:
           response = client.get("/internal/cache/status")

        2. Validate response structure and content:
           status = response.json()
           assert "redis" in status
           assert "memory" in status
           assert "performance" in status

        This ensures the status API provides complete infrastructure visibility.
