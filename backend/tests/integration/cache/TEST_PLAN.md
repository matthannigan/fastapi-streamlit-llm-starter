# Cache Infrastructure Integration Test Plan

## Overview

This test plan identifies integration test opportunities for the unified cache infrastructure service (`app.infrastructure.cache`). The cache infrastructure serves as a foundational service that affects performance, scalability, and reliability across all application components (AI processing, user sessions, API responses, background tasks), making it a critical integration point that requires comprehensive validation.

## Analysis Results

## Test Implementation Guidance

The following recommendations are based on analysis of the existing cache integration tests and are intended to ensure robust and reliable tests for the cache infrastructure service.

### Cache Factory and Security Configuration Testing

- **Factory Method Testing**: Test each factory method (`for_web_app`, `for_ai_app`, `for_testing`) to ensure they create appropriate cache configurations:
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_factory_creates_appropriate_cache_types():
    """Test that factory methods create cache instances with correct configurations."""
    factory = CacheFactory()

    # Test AI cache creation
    ai_cache = await factory.for_ai_app(performance_monitor=monitor)
    assert ai_cache is not None

    # Test web cache creation
    web_cache = await factory.for_web_app(settings=test_settings)
    assert web_cache is not None

    # Test cache isolation
    assert ai_cache is not web_cache
```

- **Security Configuration Testing**: Test security configuration integration with factory methods:
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_security_configuration_integration():
    """Test that security configuration is properly integrated into cache instances."""
    security_config = SecurityConfig(
        redis_auth="test_password",
        use_tls=True,
        connection_timeout=10
    )

    factory = CacheFactory()
    cache = await factory.for_testing(
        security_config=security_config,
        fail_on_connection_error=False
    )

    assert cache is not None
    # Test that cache operations work with security configuration
```

### Graceful Degradation and Fallback Testing

- **Redis Failure Simulation**: Test graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable:
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_graceful_degradation_behavior():
    """Test that cache gracefully degrades when Redis is unavailable."""
    factory = CacheFactory()

    # Create cache with invalid Redis URL to trigger fallback
    cache = await factory.for_web_app(
        redis_url="redis://invalid-host:99999",
        fail_on_connection_error=False
    )

    # Should create InMemoryCache fallback
    assert cache is not None

    # Test basic operations work with fallback
    await cache.set("test_key", "test_value")
    assert await cache.get("test_key") == "test_value"
```

### Health Check and Lifecycle Testing

- **Health Status Validation**: Test health check functionality with different cache states:
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health_check_with_different_cache_states():
    """Test health check behavior with healthy and degraded cache states."""
    factory = CacheFactory()

    # Test with healthy cache
    healthy_cache = await factory.for_testing(use_memory_cache=True)
    health_status = await get_cache_health_status(healthy_cache)
    assert health_status["status"] == "healthy"

    # Test with degraded cache (mock)
    degraded_cache = MagicMock()
    degraded_cache.get = AsyncMock(side_effect=Exception("Connection failed"))
    degraded_status = await get_cache_health_status(degraded_cache)
    assert degraded_status["status"] in ["degraded", "unhealthy"]
```

### Cache Component Interoperability Testing

- **Shared Contract Testing**: Test that different cache implementations behave identically:
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_cache_shared_contract_compliance(cache_instances):
    """Test that all cache implementations comply with shared contracts."""
    for cache_name, cache in cache_instances:
        # Test basic operations
        await cache.set("test_key", "test_value")
        assert await cache.get("test_key") == "test_value"
        assert await cache.exists("test_key") is True

        await cache.delete("test_key")
        assert await cache.get("test_key") is None
        assert await cache.exists("test_key") is False
```

By following these guidelines, the integration tests for the cache infrastructure will be robust, reliable, and focused on behavior rather than implementation details, ensuring the cache service integrates correctly with all application components and maintains service continuity under various scenarios.
