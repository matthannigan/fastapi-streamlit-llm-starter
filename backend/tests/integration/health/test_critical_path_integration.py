Critical Path Integration Tests for Health Monitoring System

This module implements comprehensive integration tests for the health monitoring system,
validating the complete integration from API endpoints through all infrastructure components.
Following the project's outside-in, behavior-focused testing philosophy, these tests
verify observable HTTP behavior without mocking internal components.

Test Coverage:
- TEST 1.1: All Components Healthy - Complete System Health
- TEST 1.2: Partial Degradation - Component Configuration Issues
- TEST 1.3: Critical Component Failure - System Unhealthy
- TEST 1.4: Error Isolation - Component Failures Don't Cascade

    Critical path integration tests for the complete health monitoring system.

    This test class validates the primary health monitoring integration seam:
    API endpoint → HealthChecker → All Components → Aggregated JSON response

    Integration Scope:
        - Public /v1/health endpoint (HTTP API layer)
        - HealthChecker service orchestration (infrastructure layer)
        - Component health checks: ai_model, cache, resilience (domain layer)
        - Health status aggregation logic (system layer)

    Business Impact:
        These tests validate the core health monitoring capability that enables:
        - Load balancer health checks for service availability
        - Monitoring system integration for operational visibility
        - Graceful degradation during partial infrastructure failures
        - Alerting system integration for critical component failures

    Test Strategy:
        - Outside-in approach through HTTP API endpoints only
        - Environment manipulation via monkeypatch (no internal mocking)
        - Observable behavior validation through HTTP responses
        - Contract compliance with health.pyi specifications
        - Real component health checks with authentic infrastructure interactions

    Success Criteria:
        - Health endpoint returns HTTP 200 in all system states
        - Health status aggregation follows worst-case logic from health.pyi:524-526
        - Component failures are isolated without cascading effects
        - Response includes proper timing and diagnostic information
        - System degrades gracefully rather than failing completely

        TEST 1.1: All Components Healthy - Complete System Health

        Test health endpoint returns appropriate status when infrastructure components are operational.

        Integration Scope:
            API endpoint → HealthChecker → AI/Cache/Resilience health checks → Aggregated response

        Contract Validation:
            - SystemHealthStatus.overall_status returns HEALTHY per health.pyi:524
            - All ComponentStatus objects have status=HEALTHY
            - Response includes timestamp and component details with response_time_ms measurements

            Enables monitoring systems to confirm operational capacity and validate
            that infrastructure components are functioning correctly for service delivery.

        Test Strategy:
            - Use REAL health checks (no mocking internal components)
