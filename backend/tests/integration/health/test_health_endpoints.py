Integration Tests for Health Endpoint API Integration (SEAM 1)

Tests the complete integration from HTTP API endpoints through the HealthChecker
to multi-component health status aggregation. Validates that the /v1/health
endpoint properly orchestrates health checks across all system components and
returns accurate aggregated health status.

This test file validates the critical integration seam:
API Endpoint → HealthChecker → AI/Cache/Resilience Health Checks → Aggregated Response

Test Coverage:
- Complete system health when all components operational
- Partial degradation scenarios (AI configuration missing)
- Critical failure scenarios (resilience infrastructure failure)
- Performance SLA validation for health check response times
- Response structure and metadata validation
