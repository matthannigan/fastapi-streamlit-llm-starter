# Health Monitoring Integration Test Plan

**Test Plan ID:** HMON-INT-001
**Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2025-09-30
**Priority:** High

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive integration test plan validates the health monitoring system's ability to provide reliable, multi-component health status aggregation across the FastAPI application infrastructure. The plan focuses on critical integration seams between API endpoints, dependency injection, infrastructure services, and error handling patterns.

## System Architecture Overview

### Core Components
- **HealthChecker**: Centralized health monitoring service with configurable policies
- **API Layer**: Public (`/v1/health`) and Internal (`/internal/resilience/health`) endpoints
- **Dependency Injection**: `get_health_checker()` singleton with service registration
- **Infrastructure Services**: AI Model, Cache, Resilience, and Database health checks
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and fallback mechanisms

### Integration Points Tested
1. **API → HealthChecker → Component Health Checks**
2. **HealthChecker → Cache Service → Redis/Memory Cache**
3. **HealthChecker → AI Service Configuration**
4. **HealthChecker → Resilience Infrastructure**
5. **Dependency Injection Chain Integration**

## Integration Test Scenarios
