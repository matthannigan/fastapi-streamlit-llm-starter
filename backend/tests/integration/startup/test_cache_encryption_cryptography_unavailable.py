"""
Integration tests for cache encryption without cryptography library.

This test module verifies graceful degradation and helpful error messages when
the cryptography library is unavailable. These tests run in an isolated Docker
environment where cryptography is intentionally not installed.

**Execution Requirements:**
- Run via Docker container without cryptography: ./run-no-cryptography-tests.sh
- Or manually in isolated virtualenv without cryptography package
- DO NOT run in standard test environment (will be skipped if cryptography is available)

**Test Philosophy:**
These are integration tests because:
- They test real import behavior in isolated environment
- They verify actual error messages users would see
- Unit-level mocking of library availability causes pytest internal errors
- The cryptography library imports at module load time, before test fixtures run

**Reference:**
- Test Plan: backend/tests/integration/startup/TEST_PLAN_cryptography_unavailable.md
- Implementation: backend/app/infrastructure/cache/encryption.py
