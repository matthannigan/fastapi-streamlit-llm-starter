# Integration Test Plan: Resilience Infrastructure
## Analysis of Unit Test Mocking Patterns and Integration Opportunities

This document analyzes unit test mocking patterns across the resilience infrastructure modules to identify integration testing opportunities that complement existing unit test coverage.

## Executive Summary

**Analysis Scope**: 45 unit test files across 8 resilience modules (37,932 lines of code)
**Primary Finding**: Unit tests extensively mock external dependencies at system boundaries, revealing critical integration seams that require validation with real implementations.
**Integration Priority**: Focus on third-party library integrations, performance validation, and cross-module coordination that unit tests cannot verify.

    """Verify circuit breaker opens after reaching failure threshold."""
    circuit_breaker = EnhancedCircuitBreaker(failure_threshold=3)

    # Simulate failures
    for i in range(4):
        try:
            circuit_breaker.call(lambda: (_ for _ in ()).throw(Exception("Failure")))
        except:

    # Verify circuit is open
    assert circuit_breaker.state == "OPEN"
```

**Example Integration Test (NEW, Different Concern):**
```python
async def test_circuit_breaker_tenacity_integration():

    orchestrator = AIServiceResilience()

    failing_operation = Mock(side_effect=ConnectionError("Service unavailable"))

    # Execute with both circuit breaker and retry
    with pytest.raises(ConnectionError):
        await orchestrator.execute_with_resilience(failing_operation, "test_op")

    # Verify real circuit breaker opened
    metrics = orchestrator.get_metrics()
    assert metrics["circuit_breaker"]["test_op"]["state"] == "OPEN"

    # Verify retry attempts occurred before circuit opened
    assert failing_operation.call_count > 1
```
- **Purpose**: Verify real library coordination works end-to-end
- **Value**: Catches integration bugs that unit tests miss

Both tests are needed - they verify different concerns at different levels.
