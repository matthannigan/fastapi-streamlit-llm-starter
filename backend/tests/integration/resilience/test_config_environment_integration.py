Integration tests for Resilience Orchestrator → Configuration Presets → Environment Detection seam.

This test suite validates the end-to-end configuration management flow, ensuring that:
1. Environment auto-detection correctly identifies development/production environments
2. Preset recommendation API returns appropriate recommendations based on real environment variables
3. Orchestrator loads correct configuration and applies it to actual resilience strategies
4. Configuration changes are properly propagated to all resilience components
5. Environment-specific configurations work across multiple strategy types

Business Impact:
- Critical deployment configuration management
- Ensures production environments use appropriate high-reliability settings
- Validates configuration system end-to-end functionality

Test Strategy:
- Use real environment variables and configuration system
- Test from API endpoints through to actual resilience strategy application
- Validate observable behavior, not internal state
- Use high-fidelity fixtures for comprehensive integration testing

Success Criteria:
- Tests real configuration loading and environment detection
- Complements unit tests (verifies end-to-end configuration flow)
- High business value (deployment reliability)
- Uses real environment variables and configuration system
