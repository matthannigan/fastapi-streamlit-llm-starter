## Fixture Recommendations

### ✅ Reusable Existing Fixtures

**From `integration/conftest.py`:**
- `integration_client` (line 66-73) - TestClient with production environment setup
- `authenticated_headers` (line 92-97) - Valid Authorization Bearer headers
- `async_integration_client` (line 77-88) - Async HTTP client for ASGI testing
- `monkeypatch` (built-in) - **CRITICAL**: Always use for environment variables (NEVER `os.environ`)
- `production_environment_integration` (line 37-48) - Production env with API keys
- `fakeredis_client` (line 229-262) - In-memory Redis simulation

**From `cache/conftest.py`:**
- `test_settings` (line 52-89) - Real Settings instance with test configuration
- `development_settings` / `production_settings` (line 93-161) - Environment-specific Settings

### 🔄 Fixtures to Adapt

**Test Client Pattern** (from `auth/conftest.py` and `integration/conftest.py`):
```python
@pytest.fixture
def resilience_test_client(monkeypatch):
    """Test client for resilience integration tests."""
    monkeypatch.setenv("RESILIENCE_PRESET", "simple")
    monkeypatch.setenv("API_KEY", "test-key-12345")
    app = create_app()  # AFTER environment setup
    return TestClient(app)
```

### 🆕 New Fixtures Required

**For P0-1, P0-2, P0-3, P1-6:**
```python
@pytest.fixture
async def ai_resilience_orchestrator(test_settings):
    """Real AIServiceResilience for integration testing."""
    from app.infrastructure.resilience.orchestrator import AIServiceResilience
    orchestrator = AIServiceResilience(settings=test_settings)
    yield orchestrator
    if hasattr(orchestrator, 'reset'):
        await orchestrator.reset()
```

**For P0-2:**
```python
@pytest.fixture
def preset_manager_with_env_detection():
    """Real PresetManager with environment detection."""
    from app.infrastructure.resilience.config_presets import PresetManager
    return PresetManager()
```

**For P0-3, P1-6:**
```python
@pytest.fixture
async def real_text_processor_service(ai_resilience_orchestrator):
    """Real TextProcessorService with resilience integration."""
    from app.services.text_processor import TextProcessorService
    service = TextProcessorService(resilience=ai_resilience_orchestrator)
    yield service
```

**For P0-1, P0-3:**
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_ai_service():
    """Mock AI service for testing resilience under failures."""
    from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch
    with patch('app.services.text_processor.PydanticAIAgent') as mock:
        mock_instance = AsyncMock()
        mock.return_value = mock_instance
        mock_instance.run.return_value = "AI response"
        yield mock_instance
```

**For P1-4:**
```python

    """Concurrent execution helper for load testing."""
    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
    executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10)
    yield executor

```

### Key Patterns to Follow

1. **App Factory Pattern**: Always use `create_app()` for test isolation
2. **Monkeypatch Pattern**: ALWAYS use `monkeypatch.setenv()` (NEVER `os.environ`)
3. **High-Fidelity Fakes**: Use fakeredis, real libraries (not mocks)
4. **Settings Fixtures**: Real Settings instances with test configuration
