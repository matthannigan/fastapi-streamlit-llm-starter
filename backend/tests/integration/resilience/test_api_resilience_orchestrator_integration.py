Integration tests for API → Resilience Orchestrator → Circuit Breaker → AI Service.

This test suite validates the complete integration flow from FastAPI endpoints through
the resilience orchestrator to the actual circuit breaker library and mock AI services.
Tests verify real library behavior, not mocked responses, ensuring resilience patterns
work under actual failure conditions.

Seam Under Test:
    FastAPI TestClient → API Endpoints → AIServiceResilience → EnhancedCircuitBreaker →
    Real circuitbreaker library → Mock AI Service

Critical Paths:
    - API authentication protects all resilience endpoints
    - Circuit breaker status APIs return real-time metrics from actual circuitbreaker library
    - Administrative reset functionality works through real circuit breaker state changes
    - AI service failures trigger actual circuit breaker opening (not mocked state)
    - retry logic respects real circuit breaker state (tenacity + circuitbreaker coordination)
    - Metrics collection accurately reflects real circuit breaker transitions and retry attempts

Business Impact:
    - Core administrative functionality for resilience management
    - Validates third-party library integration (circuitbreaker + tenacity)
    - Ensures resilience patterns actually work under real failure conditions
    - Critical for operational reliability and service availability

Test Strategy:
    - Use real AI service resilience orchestrator (not mocked)
    - Use real circuit breaker library (not mocked state)
    - Use high-fidelity mock AI service for controlled failure simulation
    - Test actual API endpoints with authentication
    - Verify observable behavior through API responses and circuit breaker state
    - Test all major failure scenarios and recovery patterns

Success Criteria:
    - Tests real API → Orchestrator → Circuit Breaker integration
    - Complements unit tests (verifies real library behavior, not mocked responses)
    - High business value (core resilience functionality)
    - Uses real circuitbreaker and tenacity libraries
    - All tests pass with proper isolation and cleanup
