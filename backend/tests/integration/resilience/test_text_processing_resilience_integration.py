Integration tests for Text Processing Service → Resilience Patterns → AI Integration.

Seam Under Test:
    TextProcessorService → AIServiceResilience decorators → PydanticAI agent → Cache integration

Critical Paths:
    - Text processing operations are actually protected by real resilience decorators
    - AI service failures trigger real circuit breaker protection (not mocked)
    - Transient AI failures trigger appropriate real retry behavior with tenacity
    - Graceful degradation works when AI services are unavailable
    - Performance integration: caching and resilience patterns work together efficiently
    - Real performance targets (<100ms) are met with actual resilience overhead

Business Impact:
    - Core user-facing functionality with resilience protection
    - Validates AI service integration actually works under failure conditions
    - Ensures performance SLAs are met with real resilience overhead

Test Strategy:
    - Use real TextProcessorService with resilience decorators applied
    - Use real AIServiceResilience orchestrator (not mocked)
    - Mock only the external PydanticAI agent to simulate failures
    - Verify observable behavior through service responses and metrics
    - Test actual circuit breaker state changes and retry patterns
    - Validate performance with real resilience overhead

Success Criteria:
    - Tests real domain service + resilience pattern integration
    - Complements unit tests (verifies actual resilience protection)
    - High business value (user-facing reliability)
    - Uses real domain service with resilience decorators

        Test that real performance targets (<100ms) are met with actual resilience overhead.

        Integration Scope:
            TextProcessorService, AIServiceResilience overhead, performance validation

        Business Impact:
            Ensures performance SLAs are achievable with real resilience patterns in production

        Test Strategy:
            - Test multiple operation types for performance (summarize, sentiment, key_points)
            - Measure actual processing times with resilience overhead
            - Verify performance targets are met for different scenarios
            - Validate that resilience patterns don't introduce excessive delays

        Success Criteria:
            - Performance targets are met across operation types
            - Resilience overhead is within acceptable limits
            - Processing times are consistent and predictable
            - No significant performance regression from resilience patterns

        Fixes Applied (Issues #9-#10):
            1. Mock AI responses now include proper JSON structure for sentiment analysis
               with required fields: sentiment, confidence, explanation
            2. Test assertions now check appropriate response fields per operation:
               - summarize: response.result
               - sentiment: response.sentiment
               - key_points: response.key_points
            3. Mock detects sentiment prompts via keyword matching in prompt content
