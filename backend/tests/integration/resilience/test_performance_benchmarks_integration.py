Integration tests for Performance Benchmarks → System Resources → Real Performance Validation.

This test suite validates that the PerformanceBenchmarker component correctly integrates
with real system resources (time, tracemalloc, statistics modules) to provide accurate
performance measurements and SLA validation for resilience configuration operations.

Seam Under Test:
    PerformanceBenchmarker → time/tracemalloc/statistics modules → Actual System Resources

Critical Paths:
    - Configuration loading benchmarks meet real <10ms targets (not mocked)
    - Service initialization benchmarks meet real <200ms targets
    - Memory tracking detects actual memory allocations with real tracemalloc
    - Performance regression detection works with real measurement data
    - Statistical calculations match real statistics module results
    - Concurrent operations show expected real performance characteristics

Business Impact:
    - Validates performance SLAs are actually achievable in production
    - Ensures performance monitoring works with real system behavior
    - Detects real performance regressions before deployment

Test Strategy:
    - Use real performance benchmarker implementation (not mocked)
    - Test against actual system resources and Python standard library modules
    - Verify real timing precision with time.perf_counter()
    - Validate real memory tracking with tracemalloc
    - Test statistical calculations with real statistics module
    - Ensure concurrent operation performance characteristics

Success Criteria:
    - Tests real performance with actual system resources
    - Complements unit tests (verifies real SLA achievement)
    - Medium business value (performance guarantees)
    - Uses real time, memory, and statistics modules
