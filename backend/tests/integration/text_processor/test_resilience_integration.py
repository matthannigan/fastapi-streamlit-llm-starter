Integration tests for TextProcessor with AI Resilience Orchestrator.

This module tests the integration between the TextProcessor API endpoints,
TextProcessorService, and the AI Resilience Orchestrator, ensuring that
the service properly handles AI service failures through circuit breakers,
retries, and graceful degradation patterns.

Seam Under Test:
    API Endpoint (/v1/text_processing/process) → TextProcessorService →
    AI Resilience Orchestrator → AI Service (with failure simulation)

Critical Paths:
    - Transient AI failures trigger successful retries
    - Persistent failures trigger circuit breaker opening after threshold
    - Circuit breaker open state causes fast failures (no wasted API calls)
    - Circuit breaker half-open state tests recovery with next successful call
    - Different resilience strategies work per operation type
    - Resilience orchestrator health monitoring provides accurate metrics

Business Impact:
    - Ensures service reliability during AI service outages
    - Prevents cascading failures from affecting user experience
    - Validates critical infrastructure for production stability
    - Provides operational visibility into service health

Test Strategy:
    - Use real TextProcessorService with resilience orchestrator
    - Simulate AI service failures using mock AI service fixtures
    - Test circuit breaker state transitions and recovery behavior
    - Verify resilience patterns work across different operation types
    - Validate health monitoring provides accurate operational metrics

Success Criteria:
    - Resilience tests prevent cascading failures under simulated outages
    - Circuit breaker behavior verified (open, half-open, closed states)
    - Retry mechanisms work correctly for transient failures
    - Different resilience strategies per operation verified
    - Health monitoring provides accurate metrics
