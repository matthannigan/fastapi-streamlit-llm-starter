## Deferred/Eliminated

### SEAM: TextProcessorService → PydanticAI Agent → Real AI API

**SOURCE**: CONFIRMED (Prompt 1 MEDIUM + Prompt 2 CONFIRMED)
**REASON FOR DEFERRAL**:
- ✅ **Better suited for manual testing** - Requires real API keys and costs money per test run
- ✅ **External dependency** - Depends on Gemini API availability and rate limits
- ✅ **Test reliability** - External service issues cause test flakiness
- ✅ **Cost concerns** - Each test run would incur actual AI API costs

**ALTERNATIVE**:
- Use `@pytest.mark.manual` for occasional validation with real API
- Keep existing unit tests with mocked AI agent for contract verification
- Monitor AI integration through production observability rather than automated tests

### SEAM: TextProcessorService → Operation Registry → Configuration Management

**SOURCE**: Prompt 1 only (architectural analysis)
**REASON FOR ELIMINATION**:
- ✅ **Internal implementation detail** - Operation registry is internal service configuration
- ✅ **Adequately covered by unit tests** - 25+ initialization tests verify registry behavior
- ✅ **Low integration risk** - Configuration is static after initialization
- ✅ **Low business value** - Registry issues would be caught during startup, not runtime

**ALTERNATIVE**:
- Rely on existing unit tests that verify operation registration
- Monitor configuration through service health checks
- Add logging for registry issues if needed

### SEAM: TextProcessorService → Monitoring/Logging Infrastructure

**SOURCE**: Prompt 1 only (architectural analysis)
**REASON FOR ELIMINATION**:
- ✅ **Infrastructure concern, not text processor integration** - Logging is cross-cutting concern
- ✅ **Standard patterns** - Logging integration follows well-established patterns
- ✅ **Low business value** - Logging issues don't affect core functionality
- ✅ **Better tested elsewhere** - Logging infrastructure has its own test suite

**ALTERNATIVE**:
- Verify logging through manual inspection during integration tests
- Test logging infrastructure separately
- Monitor log quality through operational observability

        backend/tests/integration/environment/conftest.py::performance_monitor (lines 362-393)

    Note:
        This fixture already exists and can be reused directly.
        Provides: start(), stop(), elapsed_ms property

    Use Cases:
        - Measuring cache performance improvement
        - Verifying batch processing timing
        - Testing performance SLAs

### Test Markers
```python
pytest.mark.integration    # All integration tests
pytest.mark.slow          # Performance and load tests
pytest.mark.security      # Security-related tests
pytest.mark.resilience    # Failure and recovery tests
pytest.mark.batch         # Batch processing tests
pytest.mark.auth          # Authentication tests
pytest.mark.manual        # Tests requiring manual execution
```

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Test environment variables needed
CACHE_PRESET=development          # Use fakeredis for tests
AI_MODEL=test-model               # Avoid real AI costs
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG                  # Detailed logging for debugging
ENVIRONMENT=testing              # Isolate test environment
```

## Success Criteria

### P0 Success Metrics
- [ ] Cache integration tests show >50% performance improvement for cached requests
- [ ] Resilience tests prevent cascading failures under simulated outages
- [ ] Security tests block 100% of known threat samples
- [ ] Authentication tests consistently enforce access control across all endpoints

### P1 Success Metrics
- [ ] Batch processing handles 100+ concurrent requests within resource limits
- [ ] Cache failure scenarios maintain 100% service availability
- [ ] Batch + cache integration shows improved performance for duplicate requests
- [ ] Health monitoring provides accurate operational data

### Quality Gates
- [ ] All tests pass consistently (no flaky tests)
- [ ] Test execution time < 5 minutes for full suite
- [ ] Code coverage integration complement (not duplicate) unit tests
- [ ] Tests provide clear failure diagnostics and debugging information

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Approve**: ✅ Completed - Plan reviewed and approved with improvements applied
2. **Infrastructure Setup**: Create required fixtures and test environment
3. **P0 Implementation**: Sprint 1 development of critical path tests (4 seams, ~19 test methods)
4. **Validation**: Run tests against staging environment
5. **P1 Implementation**: Sprint 2 hardening tests (3 seams, ~11 test methods)
6. **Documentation**: Update operational runbooks with test procedures

## Changes Applied from Review

**Priority Adjustments**:
- ✅ Moved Authentication seam from P1 to P0 (security-critical, user-facing)
- ✅ Updated Cache Failure Resilience source marker from NEW to CONFIRMED

**Missing Seam Added**:
- ✅ Added "Batch + Cache Integration" to P1 (intersection of batch and cache behavior)

**Updated Estimates**:
- P0: 24-30 hours (4 seams, ~19 test methods)
- P1: 18-22 hours (3 seams, ~11 test methods)
- P2: 2-4 hours (1 seam, ~3 test methods)

This consolidated plan provides a comprehensive, prioritized approach to integration testing that focuses on business value, complements existing unit tests, and ensures the text processing service operates reliably with all its infrastructure dependencies.
