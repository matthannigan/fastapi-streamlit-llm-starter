Integration tests for API → Authentication → TextProcessorService → Authorization Flow.

This module tests the complete authentication integration for the text processing API,
validating security boundaries, authentication consistency, and proper authorization
enforcement across all text processing endpoints.

Seam Under Test:
    API Endpoint → APIKeyAuth Middleware → TextProcessorService → Authorization Enforcement

Critical Paths:
    - Valid API key authentication flow: API Key → APIKeyAuth → TextProcessorService access
    - Invalid API key rejection flow: Invalid API Key → 401 Unauthorized response
    - Missing API key rejection flow: No API Key → 401 Unauthorized response
    - Optional authentication flow: Discovery endpoints with optional API key access

Test Business Impact:
    - Validates security boundaries for protected text processing operations
    - Ensures consistent authentication behavior across all text processing endpoints
    - Confirms proper authorization enforcement prevents unauthorized access
    - Provides confidence in access control mechanisms protecting AI processing resources
    - Verifies authentication middleware integration works correctly with text processor services

Success Criteria:
    - Authentication tests consistently enforce access control across all endpoints
    - Valid API key enables access to all text processing operations
    - Invalid/missing API keys are properly rejected with 401 status
    - Optional authentication works for discovery endpoints (operations, health)
    - Authentication behavior is consistent across all API endpoints

Test Strategy:
    - Use outside-in testing approach through HTTP API endpoints
    - Test authentication at HTTP level (not internal implementation details)
    - Verify observable outcomes (HTTP status codes, response bodies)
    - Use high-fidelity fixtures (test_client, authenticated_headers) without mocking
    - Test both required authentication and optional authentication scenarios
