"""
Integration test fixtures for text-processor testing.

This module provides fixtures for testing text processor integration with
AI services, cache infrastructure, and security validation. All fixtures
follow the App Factory Pattern for proper test isolation.

Key Fixtures:
    - test_client: HTTP client with isolated app instance
    - test_settings: Real Settings with test configuration
    - ai_response_cache: Real AIResponseCache with fakeredis
    - text_processor_service: Real TextProcessorService with dependencies
    - mock_pydantic_agent: Mock PydanticAI agent for controlled testing
    - failing_cache: Cache wrapper that simulates failures
    - batch_request_data: Sample batch processing data
    - threat_samples: Security threat samples for validation

Shared Fixtures (from backend/tests/integration/conftest.py):
    - fakeredis_client: High-fidelity Redis fake (lines 229-262)
    - authenticated_headers: Valid API authentication (lines 92-97)
    - invalid_api_key_headers: Invalid auth headers (lines 101-106)
    - production_environment_integration: Production env setup (lines 36-50)
    - performance_monitor: Performance timing utility (lines 362-393 in environment/conftest.py)

Usage:
    Test files in this directory automatically have access to all fixtures
    defined here and in parent conftest.py files.

    ```python
    def test_text_processing_integration(test_client, authenticated_headers):
        response = test_client.post(
            "/api/v1/text-processing/sentiment",
            headers=authenticated_headers,
            json={"text": "This is great!"}
        )
        assert response.status_code == 200
    ```

Critical Patterns:
    - Always use monkeypatch.setenv() for environment variables
    - Set environment BEFORE creating app/settings
    - Use function scope for test isolation
    - Use high-fidelity fakes (fakeredis) over mocks

    Performance monitoring for testing text processor timing and metrics.

    Provides timing utilities for measuring text processing performance,
    cache optimization effects, and batch processing efficiency.

    Returns:
        PerformanceMonitor: Object with start(), stop(), and elapsed_ms property

    Note:
        Similar implementation to backend/tests/integration/environment/conftest.py:362-393

    Use Cases:
        - Measuring cache performance improvement for text processing
        - Verifying batch processing timing meets SLAs
        - Testing performance of different text operations

"""
Authentication Fixtures (from backend/tests/integration/conftest.py):

- authenticated_headers (lines 92-97): Valid Bearer token authentication
- invalid_api_key_headers (lines 101-106): Invalid authentication for error testing
- x_api_key_headers (lines 110-115): X-API-Key header format
- production_environment_integration (lines 36-50): Production environment setup

These fixtures are imported automatically via pytest's conftest.py inheritance
and can be used directly in text processor integration tests.

Usage:
    def test_with_auth(test_client, authenticated_headers):
        response = test_client.post("/v1/text-processing/sentiment",
                                   headers=authenticated_headers,

Shared Fixtures Available from Parent conftest.py:

From backend/tests/integration/conftest.py:

1. fakeredis_client (lines 229-262):
   - High-fidelity Redis fake for cache integration testing
   - In-memory Redis simulation with full API compatibility
   - decode_responses=False matches production behavior
   - Function-scoped for fresh instance per test
   - Use: Import directly, no modifications needed

2. authenticated_headers (lines 92-97):
   - Headers with valid authentication for API testing
   - Returns: {"Authorization": "Bearer test-api-key-12345", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
   - Function scope, suitable for all authenticated endpoint tests

3. invalid_api_key_headers (lines 101-106):
   - Headers with invalid API key for authentication error testing
   - Returns: {"Authorization": "Bearer invalid-api-key-12345", "Content-Type": "application/json"}

4. production_environment_integration (lines 36-50):
   - Production environment setup with API keys
   - Uses monkeypatch for proper cleanup
   - Sets ENVIRONMENT="production" and test API keys

5. validate_environment_state (lines 134-197):
   - Environment state validation for detecting test pollution
   - Provides functions to monitor environment changes during tests

6. environment_state_guard (lines 265-298):
   - Automatic environment state monitoring (autouse fixture)
   - Reports environment changes that might indicate test pollution

Note: These fixtures are automatically available to all tests in this directory
through pytest's conftest.py inheritance mechanism. No explicit imports needed.
