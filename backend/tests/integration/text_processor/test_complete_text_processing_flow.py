HIGH PRIORITY: API → TextProcessorService → AI Infrastructure → Resilience Pipeline Integration Test

This test suite verifies the complete integration flow from API endpoints through the TextProcessorService
to the AI infrastructure and resilience patterns. It ensures that the entire text processing pipeline
functions correctly with all security, caching, and resilience features working together.

Integration Scope:
    Tests the complete flow from HTTP API requests through TextProcessorService to AI processing
    with input sanitization, caching, resilience patterns, and output validation.

Seam Under Test:
    API endpoints → TextProcessorService → PromptSanitizer → PydanticAI Agent → ResponseValidator

Critical Paths:
    - User request → Input sanitization → AI processing → Output validation → Response
    - Authentication and authorization flow
    - Request tracing and logging integration
    - Resilience pattern integration (circuit breakers, retries, fallbacks)

Business Impact:
    Core text processing functionality that directly affects user experience and system security.
    Failures here impact the primary value proposition of the application.

Test Strategy:
    - Test complete pipeline with both success and failure scenarios
    - Verify input sanitization and security validation
    - Test AI processing with caching integration
    - Validate output security and quality checks
    - Confirm resilience pattern behavior
    - Test authentication and authorization flow
    - Verify request tracing and logging

Success Criteria:
    - Complete pipeline processes requests successfully
    - Input sanitization blocks malicious input appropriately
    - AI processing integrates with caching and resilience
    - Output validation ensures safe responses
    - Authentication prevents unauthorized access
    - Comprehensive logging provides operational visibility
    - System recovers gracefully from failures

        Business Impact:
            Ensures comprehensive request tracking for debugging, monitoring,
