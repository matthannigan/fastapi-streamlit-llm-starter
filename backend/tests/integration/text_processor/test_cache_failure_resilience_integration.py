Integration tests for TextProcessorService → AIResponseCache → Cache Failure Resilience.

This test suite validates the resilience patterns and graceful degradation behavior
of the text processing service when cache infrastructure experiences failures.
The tests ensure service availability is maintained even during cache issues.

⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTE**: These tests are currently SKIPPED because the TextProcessorService
does not yet implement graceful degradation for cache failures. The current implementation
allows cache InfrastructureError exceptions to propagate and cause service failures.

**Expected Behavior (Not Yet Implemented)**:
- Cache lookup failures should trigger AI processing fallback
- Cache storage failures should not prevent successful response return
- Service should log warnings about cache unavailability
- Service should recover when cache becomes available again

**Current Actual Behavior**:
- Cache failures cause InfrastructureError to propagate
- Service becomes unavailable when cache infrastructure fails
- No graceful degradation is implemented for cache issues

These tests serve as documentation for the required resilience patterns and can be
used to validate the implementation once cache failure handling is added to the
TextProcessorService.

Test Architecture:
    - Outside-in approach starting from TextProcessorService
    - High-fidelity failure simulation via FailingCacheWrapper
    - Real service behavior with observable outcomes
    - Complete test isolation using function-scoped fixtures

Critical Paths Tested (Expected Behavior):
    - Cache lookup failure → AI processing fallback
    - Cache storage failure → Successful response return
    - Cache unavailability → Warning logging and graceful degradation
    - Cache recovery → Normal operation restoration
    - Multiple failure scenarios → Resilience validation

Business Impact:
    - Ensures 100% service availability during cache infrastructure issues
    - Validates graceful degradation patterns maintain user experience
    - Provides operational visibility through proper warning logging
    - Confirms service recovery when cache becomes available again

    Cache failure resilience is not yet implemented in TextProcessorService.

    Current Behavior: Cache get failures cause InfrastructureError to propagate,
    resulting in service failure instead of graceful degradation to AI processing.

    Expected Behavior: Service should catch cache InfrastructureError, log warning,
    and proceed with AI processing as fallback mechanism.

    Required Implementation:
    1. Wrap cache.get() calls in try-catch blocks in process_text()
    2. Log appropriate warnings when cache failures occur
    3. Continue with AI processing when cache is unavailable
    4. Set cache_hit=False in response when fallback is used

            - Confirms graceful degradation handling for complex failure scenarios

        Test Strategy:
            - Test intermittent cache failures (get fails, set succeeds)
            - Test complete cache failures (both get and set fail)
            - Test partial cache recovery scenarios
            - Verify service maintains stability across all scenarios
            - Confirm consistent fallback behavior regardless of failure type

        Success Criteria:
            - Service remains stable across all cache failure scenarios
            - AI fallback works consistently regardless of failure type
            - No cascading failures from cache issues
            - Service logs appropriate warnings for different failure types
            - Response quality remains consistent across scenarios
