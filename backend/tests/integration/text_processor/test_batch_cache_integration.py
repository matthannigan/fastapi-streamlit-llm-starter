"""
Integration tests for API → TextProcessorService → Batch + Cache Integration.

This test module validates the critical integration seam between the batch processing
API endpoint, TextProcessorService, and AIResponseCache, ensuring that cache optimization
works correctly in batch processing scenarios.

Seam Under Test:
    API Endpoint (/v1/text_processing/batch_process) → TextProcessorService → AIResponseCache → fakeredis

Critical Paths:
    - Batch with duplicate requests hits cache correctly without redundant AI calls
    - Duplicate detection works across batch items (5 duplicates in batch of 10 = 5 AI calls)
    - Cache hit rate improves batch performance significantly
    - Individual request cache behavior maintained in batch context
    - Concurrent cache access in batch processing works correctly

Business Impact:
    - Prevents redundant AI calls in batch operations (cost savings)
    - Improves batch processing performance through caching
    - Validates cache efficiency in high-concurrency scenarios
    - Ensures cache state consistency during batch operations
