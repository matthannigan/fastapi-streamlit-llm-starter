        Environment Detection → Security Policy Enforcement → Authentication Behavior → API Access Control

    Critical Paths:
        - Production environment → Strict security enforcement → API key validation → Access control

        - Security context override → Environment-agnostic enforcement → Compliance requirements
        - Environment detection failure → Fail-secure behavior → Safe defaults
