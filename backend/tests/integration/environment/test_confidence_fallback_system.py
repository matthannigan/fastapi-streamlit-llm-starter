failure conditions, ensuring reliable environment detection even when primary
signals are unavailable and that all dependent services handle fallback gracefully.

        Test that environment signal precedence and override behavior works correctly.
        
        Integration Scope:
            Multiple signals → Precedence rules → Override logic → Final determination
            
        Business Impact:
            Ensures predictable environment detection when multiple signals are present,
            following documented precedence rules for reliable configuration
            
        Test Strategy:
            - Set signals with different precedence levels
            - Test that higher precedence signals override lower ones
            - Verify override behavior is consistent and documented
            - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
            
        Success Criteria:
            - Higher precedence signals override lower precedence ones
            - Override behavior is consistent across detection calls
            - Precedence rules are documented and followed
            - Edge cases are handled gracefully
