# Environment Detection Integration Test Plan

## Overview

This test plan identifies integration test opportunities for the unified environment detection service (`app.core.environment`). The environment detection component serves as a foundational service that affects configuration across all infrastructure components (cache, resilience, security), making it a critical integration point that requires comprehensive validation.

## Analysis Results

Based on analysis of `backend/contracts` directory, the environment detection service integrates with:

### **Critical Integration Points Identified:**

1. **Security/Auth System Integration** - Environment detection drives production security enforcement
2. **Cache Preset System Integration** - Environment affects cache configuration recommendations
3. **Resilience Preset System Integration** - Environment determines resilience strategy selection
4. **API Authentication Endpoints** - Environment detection influences authentication behavior
5. **Module Import and Initialization** - Environment detection affects service startup and global state

### **Integration Seams Discovered:**

---

## Test Implementation Guidance

The following recommendations are based on learnings from the `auth` integration tests and are intended to ensure robust and reliable tests for the environment detection service.

### Environment Variable Management and Test Isolation

- **`clean_environment` Fixture**: Create a `clean_environment` fixture that runs for each test function. This fixture should back up `os.environ` before the test, clear out any environment variables that could affect environment detection, and restore the original environment after the test. This is critical for test isolation.

```python
@pytest.fixture
def clean_environment():
    """
    Provides a clean environment for testing by backing up and restoring os.environ.
    
    This fixture ensures test isolation by:
    1. Backing up the current environment variables
    2. Clearing variables that affect environment detection
    3. Restoring the original environment after the test
    
    Use this fixture in ALL environment detection tests to prevent test pollution.
    """
    # Store original environment
    original_environ = os.environ.copy()
    
    # Clear environment variables that affect detection
    for var in ["ENVIRONMENT", "ENV", "APP_ENV", "STAGE", "DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT"]:
        if var in os.environ:
            del os.environ[var]
    
    yield
    
    # Restore original environment
    os.environ.clear()
    os.environ.update(original_environ)
```

- **Environment-Specific Fixtures**: Develop fixtures like `development_environment`, `production_environment`, and `staging_environment` that use the `clean_environment` fixture to set up specific test scenarios.

```python
@pytest.fixture
def production_environment(clean_environment):
    """
    Configures environment variables for a production environment.
    
    This fixture:
    1. Sets ENVIRONMENT=production
    2. Sets other production indicators
    3. Reloads the environment module to pick up changes
    
    Returns the expected Environment enum and EnvironmentInfo for verification.
    """
    os.environ["ENVIRONMENT"] = "production"
    
    # Force reload of environment module to pick up new variables
    import importlib
    from app.core import environment
    importlib.reload(environment)
    
    return Environment.PRODUCTION, environment.get_environment_info()
```

- **`no_parallel` Marker**: For tests that modify global state or cannot be run in parallel for other reasons, use a `no_parallel` marker.

```python
# In conftest.py
def pytest_configure(config):
    config.addinivalue_line("markers", 
                           "no_parallel: mark test to not be run in parallel with other tests")

# In test file
@pytest.mark.no_parallel
def test_global_detector_initialization():
    """Tests that affect global module state should be run sequentially."""
    ...
```

### Module Reloading and System Isolation

- **Reloading After Environment Changes**: When a test modifies environment variables, reload the environment module:

```python
def test_environment_change_propagation():
    # Set initial environment
    os.environ["ENVIRONMENT"] = "development"
    
    # Import and get initial state
    from app.core import environment
    initial_env = environment.get_environment_info()
    assert initial_env.environment == Environment.DEVELOPMENT
    
    # Change environment
    os.environ["ENVIRONMENT"] = "production"
    
    # MUST reload module to pick up changes
    import importlib
    importlib.reload(environment)
    
    # Verify change propagated
    updated_env = environment.get_environment_info()
    assert updated_env.environment == Environment.PRODUCTION
```

- **Service Dependency Testing**: Test how other services respond to environment module reloading:

```python
def test_service_adapts_to_environment_change():
    # Set up initial environment
    os.environ["ENVIRONMENT"] = "development"
    
    # Initialize service with development environment
    from app.core import environment
    from app.services import cache_service
    
    cache = cache_service.CacheService()
    initial_ttl = cache.get_default_ttl()
    
    # Change environment
    os.environ["ENVIRONMENT"] = "production"
    importlib.reload(environment)
    
    # Service should detect the change and adapt behavior
    cache.refresh_configuration()  # Method that reloads environment settings
    production_ttl = cache.get_default_ttl()
    
    # Verify observable behavior change
    assert production_ttl != initial_ttl
    assert production_ttl > initial_ttl  # Production typically has longer TTLs
```

### Behavior-Focused Testing Approach

- **Focus on Observable Outcomes**: Test what dependent services actually do based on environment, not just what the detector returns:

```python
def test_security_enforcement_behavior_in_production():
    """Test that production environment enforces API key requirements."""
    # Set up production environment
    os.environ["ENVIRONMENT"] = "production"
    
    # Initialize application with production environment
    from app.main import app
    from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
    
    client = TestClient(app)
    
    # Test behavior - should require API key in production
    response = client.get("/api/v1/secured-endpoint")
    assert response.status_code == 401
    
    # With valid key should succeed
    response = client.get("/api/v1/secured-endpoint", 
                         headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {valid_test_key}"})
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

- **Testing Failure Scenarios**: Ensure proper behavior during detection failures:

```python
def test_services_handle_environment_detection_failure():
    """Test that services continue functioning when environment detection fails."""
    # Cause environment detection to fail by providing conflicting signals
    os.environ["ENVIRONMENT"] = "invalid_value"
    os.environ["DEPLOYMENT_STAGE"] = "something_else"
    
    # Import with intentionally confusing environment
    from app.core import environment
    importlib.reload(environment)
    
    # Initialize services that depend on environment detection
    from app.services import cache_service, resilience_service, auth_service
    
    # Services should use safe defaults and not crash
    cache = cache_service.CacheService()
    resilience = resilience_service.ResilienceService()
    auth = auth_service.AuthService()
    
    # Verify they all function with fallback behavior
    assert cache.is_available()
    assert resilience.is_available()
    assert auth.is_available()
    
    # Verify they use expected fallback behavior
    env_info = environment.get_environment_info()
    assert env_info.confidence < 0.5  # Low confidence due to conflicts
```

By following these guidelines, the integration tests for the `environment` module will be robust, reliable, and focused on behavior rather than implementation details.
