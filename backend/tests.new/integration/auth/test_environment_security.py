Environment-Aware Security Enforcement Integration Tests

HIGH PRIORITY - Security critical, affects all authentication decisions

INTEGRATION SCOPE:
    Tests collaboration between APIKeyAuth, EnvironmentDetector, AuthConfig, and get_environment_info
    components for environment-driven security policy enforcement.

SEAM UNDER TEST:
    APIKeyAuth → EnvironmentDetector → AuthConfig → Security enforcement

CRITICAL PATH:
    Environment detection → Security configuration → Authentication enforcement → Access control

BUSINESS IMPACT:
    Ensures appropriate security enforcement based on deployment environment, preventing
    misconfigurations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

TEST STRATEGY:
    - Test production environments requiring API keys
    - Test development environments allowing unauthenticated access
    - Test environment detection failures and fallback behavior
    - Test security policy enforcement based on environment confidence
    - Test environment variable precedence and configuration rules

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
    - Production environments enforce API key requirements
    - Development environments allow bypass when no keys configured
    - Environment detection failures default to secure behavior
    - Security policies correctly applied based on environment context
    - Environment variable configuration properly respected
