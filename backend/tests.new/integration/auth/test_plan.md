# Authentication Security Integration Test Plan

## Overview

This test plan identifies integration test opportunities for the environment-aware authentication security system (`app.infrastructure.security.auth`). The authentication component serves as a critical security foundation that affects all protected endpoints, making it essential to validate its integration with environment detection, exception handling, and FastAPI dependency injection systems.

## Analysis Results

Based on analysis of `backend/contracts` directory, the authentication security service integrates with:

### **Critical Integration Points Identified:**

1. **Environment Detection Integration** - Authentication security policies driven by environment detection
2. **Exception Handling Integration** - Custom exceptions with HTTP conversion and context preservation
3. **FastAPI Dependency Integration** - Multiple authentication dependencies for different use cases
4. **API Endpoint Integration** - Authentication status endpoint demonstrating complete flow
5. **Configuration Integration** - Environment variable-based security configuration
6. **Security Middleware Integration** - HTTP exception conversion for middleware compatibility

### **Integration Seams Discovered:**

| Seam | Components Involved | Critical Path | Priority |
|------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Environment-Aware Security Enforcement** | `APIKeyAuth` → `EnvironmentDetector` → `AuthConfig` | Environment detection → Security policy → Authentication enforcement | HIGH |
| **HTTP Exception Conversion** | `verify_api_key_http` → `AuthenticationError` → `HTTPException` | Exception raising → HTTP conversion → Response formatting | HIGH |
| **FastAPI Dependency Injection** | `Depends(verify_api_key_http)` → Authentication validation → Route access | Dependency resolution → Auth validation → Endpoint execution | HIGH |
| **Multi-Key Authentication** | `APIKeyAuth` → `AuthConfig` → Environment variables | Key loading → Validation → Access control | MEDIUM |
| **Authentication Status API** | `/v1/auth/status` → `verify_api_key_http` → `EnvironmentDetector` | HTTP request → Auth validation → Environment-aware response | MEDIUM |
| **Programmatic Authentication** | `verify_api_key_string` → `APIKeyAuth` → Environment detection | String validation → Auth system → Environment-based behavior | MEDIUM |
