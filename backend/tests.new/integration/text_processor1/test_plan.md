# Text Processor Service Integration Test Plan

## Overview

This comprehensive test plan identifies critical integration points within the Text Processor Service system, focusing on component collaboration, caching integration, security validation, and resilience patterns. The plan follows the project's behavior-focused integration testing philosophy, emphasizing critical paths, contract verification, and real-world operational scenarios.

## System Architecture Analysis

The Text Processor Service consists of these primary components:

- **AI Infrastructure** (`infrastructure/ai/`) - Input sanitization, prompt building, and security
- **Cache Infrastructure** (`infrastructure/cache/`) - AI response caching with Redis and memory fallback
- **Resilience Infrastructure** (`infrastructure/resilience/`) - Circuit breakers, retries, and fallback strategies
- **PydanticAI Agent** - AI model integration with configurable models
- **Settings & Configuration** - Application configuration with environment-based overrides
- **API Endpoints** (`/v1/text_processing/`) - REST API layer with authentication and validation
