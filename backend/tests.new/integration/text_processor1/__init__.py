Integration test package for TextProcessorService.

This package contains comprehensive integration tests for the TextProcessorService
and its related components, following the project's behavioral testing philosophy.

Test Organization:
- test_complete_text_processing_flow.py: End-to-end text processing integration

Test Philosophy:
- Focus on behavior over implementation details
- Test contracts defined in docstrings and type hints
- Verify integration seams between components
- Use high-fidelity mocks for external dependencies
- Ensure proper test isolation and state management
