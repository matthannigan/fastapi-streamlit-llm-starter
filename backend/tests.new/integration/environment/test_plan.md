# Environment Detection Integration Test Plan

## Overview

This test plan identifies integration test opportunities for the unified environment detection service (`app.core.environment`). The environment detection component serves as a foundational service that affects configuration across all infrastructure components (cache, resilience, security), making it a critical integration point that requires comprehensive validation.

## Analysis Results

Based on analysis of `backend/contracts` directory, the environment detection service integrates with:

### **Critical Integration Points Identified:**

1. **Security/Auth System Integration** - Environment detection drives production security enforcement
2. **Cache Preset System Integration** - Environment affects cache configuration recommendations
3. **Resilience Preset System Integration** - Environment determines resilience strategy selection
4. **API Authentication Endpoints** - Environment detection influences authentication behavior

### **Integration Seams Discovered:**

| Seam | Components Involved | Critical Path | Priority |
|------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Security Environment Enforcement** | `APIKeyAuth` → `EnvironmentDetector` | Request → Authentication → Environment-based security rules | HIGH |
| **Cache Preset Recommendation** | `CachePresetManager` → `EnvironmentDetector` | Environment detection → Cache configuration selection | MEDIUM |
| **Resilience Preset Recommendation** | `ResiliencePresetManager` → `EnvironmentDetector` | Environment detection → Resilience strategy selection | MEDIUM |
| **Authentication Status API** | `/v1/auth/status` → `verify_api_key_http` → `EnvironmentDetector` | API request → Authentication → Environment-aware response | MEDIUM |

## Test Implementation Guidance

The following recommendations are based on learnings from the `auth` integration tests and are intended to ensure robust and reliable tests for the environment detection service.

### Environment Variable Management and Test Isolation

- **`clean_environment` Fixture**: Create a `clean_environment` fixture that runs for each test function. This fixture should back up `os.environ` before the test, clear out any environment variables that could affect environment detection, and restore the original environment after the test. This is critical for test isolation.
- **Environment-Specific Fixtures**: Develop fixtures like `development_environment`, `production_environment`, and `staging_environment` that use the `clean_environment` fixture to set up specific test scenarios. This will make it easy to test the `EnvironmentDetector` in a variety of controlled conditions.
- **`no_parallel` Marker**: For tests that modify global state or cannot be run in parallel for other reasons, use a `no_parallel` marker. This will allow for running these tests sequentially, while the rest of the tests can be run in parallel, as is done in the `auth` integration tests.

### Configuration Reloading

- **Reloading Modules**: When a test modifies environment variables, it is essential to reload any modules that read those variables at import time. The `importlib.reload()` function can be used for this purpose. For example, if the `EnvironmentDetector` is initialized when its module is imported, you will need to reload it to pick up changes to `os.environ`.
- **Dependency Re-initialization**: Any components that depend on the `EnvironmentDetector` may also need to be re-initialized. For example, if a `CachePresetManager` is created with an instance of the `EnvironmentDetector`, a new `CachePresetManager` may need to be created after the environment has been changed and the `EnvironmentDetector` has been reloaded.

### Mocking and Patching

- **Mocking `EnvironmentDetector`**: For tests of components that *use* the `EnvironmentDetector` (e.g., `CachePresetManager`), it can be useful to mock the `EnvironmentDetector` to return a specific environment. This isolates the component being tested from the environment detection logic.
- **Patching `os.environ`**: For tests of the `EnvironmentDetector` itself, the `unittest.mock.patch.dict` function can be used to temporarily modify `os.environ` for the duration of a test. This is a clean way to simulate different environment variable configurations without affecting other tests.

By following these guidelines, the integration tests for the `environment` module will be robust, reliable, and easy to maintain.
