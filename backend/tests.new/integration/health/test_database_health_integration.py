    Seam Under Test:

    Critical Path:
        Health check registration → Database connection → Test query execution → Status determination

    Business Impact:
        This seam is a placeholder to guide future development. When a database is integrated,
        these tests will ensure database connectivity and prevent application failures
        due to database unavailability.

    Test Strategy:
        - Test current placeholder implementation behavior
        - Verify placeholder returns expected healthy status
        - Confirm placeholder doesn't perform actual database operations
        - Validate response structure and timing characteristics

    Success Criteria:
        - Placeholder implementation returns HEALTHY status consistently
        - Response structure matches ComponentStatus contract
        - Response time is minimal (no actual database operations)
