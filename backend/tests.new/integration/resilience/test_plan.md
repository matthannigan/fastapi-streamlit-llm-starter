# Resilience Infrastructure Integration Test Plan

## Overview

This comprehensive test plan identifies critical integration points within the Resilience Infrastructure System, focusing on component collaboration, configuration management, and fault tolerance patterns. The plan follows the project's behavior-focused integration testing philosophy, emphasizing critical paths, contract verification, and real-world operational scenarios.

## System Architecture Analysis

The Resilience Infrastructure consists of these primary components:

- **AIServiceResilience** (`orchestrator.py`) - Main orchestration layer
- **EnhancedCircuitBreaker** (`circuit_breaker.py`) - Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- **Retry Logic** (`retry.py`) - Intelligent retry mechanisms with exception classification
- **Configuration Management** (`config_presets.py`) - Strategy-based configuration system
- **Performance Monitoring** (`performance_benchmarks.py`) - Performance tracking and validation
- **Configuration Monitoring** (`config_monitoring.py`) - Usage tracking and metrics collection

## Critical Integration Points Identified

### 1. SEAM: API → Resilience Orchestrator → Circuit Breaker → Retry Pipeline
**PRIORITY: HIGH** (Core user-facing resilience functionality)

**COMPONENTS**: `/v1/*` endpoints → AIServiceResilience → EnhancedCircuitBreaker → Retry mechanisms

**CRITICAL PATH**: User request → Resilience orchestration → Failure detection → Retry execution → Response

**TEST SCENARIOS**:
- A user's request succeeds on the first try when the AI service is healthy, and the circuit breaker remains closed.
- A user's request initially fails due to a temporary AI service error but succeeds after a retry, demonstrating the retry mechanism is working.
- The system correctly opens the circuit breaker to prevent further requests after repeated failures, protecting the AI service from overload.
- A user can successfully complete a request after a temporary service outage without manual intervention, as the circuit breaker automatically transitions to half-open and then closed.
- The system provides a graceful fallback response to the user when the AI service is unavailable and retries are exhausted.
- The system remains stable and handles requests correctly even when multiple users make concurrent requests during a period of service instability.

**INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS**: Test database, fakeredis for cache simulation, mocked AI service responses

**BUSINESS IMPACT**: Core resilience functionality that directly affects user experience during AI service outages

### 2. SEAM: Configuration → Environment Detection → Strategy Selection
**PRIORITY: HIGH** (Configuration correctness affects all resilience behavior)

**COMPONENTS**: EnvironmentDetector → ResilienceConfig → Strategy selection → Operation configuration

**CRITICAL PATH**: Environment variables → Configuration loading → Strategy resolution → Operation-specific settings

**TEST SCENARIOS**:
- The system applies the correct resilience strategy based on the detected environment (e.g., 'development' vs. 'production').
- A custom resilience configuration for a specific operation correctly overrides the default strategy.
- The system can dynamically register and apply configurations for new operations at runtime.
- The application handles invalid or malformed configuration files gracefully and provides clear error messages.
- The system can successfully migrate legacy configurations to the new preset-based format.
- The resilience configuration can be updated at runtime without causing system instability.

**INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS**: Environment variable mocking, configuration file fixtures

**BUSINESS IMPACT**: Incorrect configuration leads to inappropriate resilience behavior affecting system reliability

### 4. SEAM: Configuration Migration → Validation → Monitoring
**PRIORITY: MEDIUM** (Configuration lifecycle management)

**COMPONENTS**: LegacyConfigAnalyzer → ConfigurationMigrator → ResilienceConfigValidator → ConfigurationMetricsCollector

**CRITICAL PATH**: Legacy configuration → Migration analysis → Validation → Usage tracking

**TEST SCENARIOS**:
- The system can automatically migrate a complex, legacy resilience configuration to the simpler, preset-based format.
- The configuration validation process includes security checks to prevent insecure settings, such as overly permissive rate limiting.
- The system provides a confidence score for each automated migration, helping operators to assess the reliability of the new configuration.
- All changes to the resilience configuration are tracked in an audit trail.
- The system provides detailed and actionable error messages when it encounters an invalid configuration.
- The correctness of a migrated configuration is verified through a post-migration validation step.

**INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS**: Legacy configuration fixtures, validation service setup

**BUSINESS IMPACT**: Ensures smooth configuration evolution and maintains system stability during updates

---

### 5. SEAM: Circuit Breaker State Management → Health Checks → Recovery
**PRIORITY: HIGH** (System availability and recovery mechanisms)

**COMPONENTS**: EnhancedCircuitBreaker → Health status → Recovery mechanisms → Monitoring integration

**CRITICAL PATH**: Failure detection → State management → Health reporting → Recovery orchestration

**TEST SCENARIOS**:
- The system correctly transitions the circuit breaker from closed to open after repeated failures, and then to half-open and back to closed after a successful recovery.
- The overall system health status, as reported by the health check endpoint, accurately reflects the state of the circuit breakers.
- The system automatically attempts to recover from a failure after a configured timeout period.
- The state of the circuit breaker is preserved across service restarts, preventing the system from flooding a failing service with requests.
- The health endpoint of the internal API provides accurate and up-to-date information on the status of all circuit breakers.
- The system maintains separate circuit breakers for different operations, ensuring that a failure in one does not affect others.

**INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS**: Circuit breaker state persistence, health check endpoints

**BUSINESS IMPACT**: Critical for system availability and automatic recovery during failures

### 6. SEAM: Exception Classification → Retry Strategy → Fallback Execution
**PRIORITY: HIGH** (Error handling and graceful degradation)

**COMPONENTS**: Exception classification → Retry strategy selection → Fallback mechanism → Orchestrator coordination

**CRITICAL PATH**: Exception occurrence → Classification → Retry decision → Fallback execution → Result handling

**TEST SCENARIOS**:
- The system can distinguish between temporary (transient) and permanent errors, applying the correct resilience strategy for each.
- The system applies different retry strategies for different types of exceptions, allowing for fine-tuned error handling.
- When a request ultimately fails, the system executes a fallback function to provide a graceful response to the user.
- The system preserves the original request context across multiple retry attempts.
- When all retry attempts are exhausted, the system handles the failure gracefully without crashing.
- The system logs a clear and detailed audit trail of all exceptions and retries.

**INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS**: Exception simulation fixtures, fallback function mocking

**BUSINESS IMPACT**: Ensures appropriate error handling and graceful degradation for user experience
