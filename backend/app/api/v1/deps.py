"""Domain Service: API Dependency Providers

ðŸ“š **EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTATION** - Replace in your project  
ðŸ’¡ **Demonstrates infrastructure usage patterns**  
ðŸ”„ **Expected to be modified/replaced**

This module provides FastAPI dependency providers for domain services, demonstrating
how to compose infrastructure services into domain-specific dependency injection
patterns. It serves as an example for building dependency hierarchies that combine
multiple infrastructure services.

## Core Components

### Dependency Providers
- `get_text_processor()`: Async text processor service provider
- `get_text_processor_service()`: Sync text processor service provider

### Service Composition
Both providers demonstrate how to:
- Inject multiple infrastructure dependencies (settings, cache)
- Compose them into domain service instances
- Handle async vs sync dependency patterns
- Avoid caching issues with non-hashable dependencies

## Dependencies & Integration

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- `get_settings()`: Application settings dependency from core infrastructure
- `get_cache_service()`: Cache service dependency from infrastructure layer
- `TextProcessorService`: Domain service that composes infrastructure services

### Composition Patterns
- **Multi-dependency injection**: Combines settings and cache services
- **Service instantiation**: Creates configured domain service instances
- **Async compatibility**: Provides both sync and async variants

## Usage Examples

### In API Endpoints
```python
@router.post("/process")
async def process_text(
    request: TextProcessingRequest,
    text_processor: TextProcessorService = Depends(get_text_processor)
):
    return await text_processor.process_text(request)
```

### Dependency Chain
```
API Endpoint â†’ get_text_processor() â†’ TextProcessorService(settings, cache)
                â†‘                           â†‘          â†‘
        FastAPI DI              get_settings()  get_cache_service()
```

## Implementation Notes

This module demonstrates domain-level dependency patterns that:
- Compose infrastructure services into domain services
- Handle complex dependency hierarchies with proper injection
- Provide both sync and async variants for different use cases
- Avoid common pitfalls like caching non-hashable objects

**Replace in your project** - Customize the dependency providers and service
composition patterns based on your specific domain service requirements.
