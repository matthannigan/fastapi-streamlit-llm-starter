Infrastructure Services Package

This package contains business-agnostic, reusable technical capabilities that form the
foundation of the FastAPI backend application. These services are designed to be stable,
well-tested, configuration-driven, and production-ready across diverse business domains.

## Package Architecture

Infrastructure services follow clean architecture principles with **dependency inversion**:
- **Domain services depend on infrastructure services** (not the reverse)
- **Infrastructure services depend only on external libraries** (Redis, AI APIs, etc.)
- **All dependencies flow inward** toward business logic
- **Interfaces are stable** while implementations can evolve

This design ensures that business logic remains independent of technical implementation
details while providing robust, reusable technical capabilities.

## Usage Patterns

### Dependency Injection (Recommended)
```python
from app.infrastructure.cache import get_cache_service, get_ai_cache_service
from app.infrastructure.resilience import with_operation_resilience
from app.infrastructure.security import verify_api_key

# FastAPI dependency injection
@app.get("/protected")
async def endpoint(
    cache=Depends(get_ai_cache_service),
    api_key=Depends(verify_api_key)
):
    return await cache.get_cached_response(...)
```

### Direct Service Usage
```python
from app.infrastructure.cache import CacheFactory
from app.infrastructure.ai import sanitize_input_advanced
from app.infrastructure.resilience import AIServiceResilience

# Direct instantiation for custom use cases
cache = CacheFactory.for_ai_app(redis_url="redis://localhost:6379")
clean_input = sanitize_input_advanced(user_text)
resilience = AIServiceResilience()
```

### Decorator-Based Resilience
```python
from app.infrastructure.resilience import with_operation_resilience

@with_operation_resilience("summarize")
async def ai_operation(text: str):
    # Automatic circuit breaker, retry, and monitoring
    return await ai_service.summarize(text)
```

### Configuration-Based Setup
```python
from app.infrastructure.cache import CacheConfigBuilder, CacheFactory

# Builder pattern for complex configurations
config = (CacheConfigBuilder()
          .for_environment("production")
          .with_redis("redis://localhost:6379")
          .with_ai_features()
          .with_security(use_tls=True)
          .build())
cache = CacheFactory.create_cache_from_config(config)
```

## Integration Architecture

### Cross-Service Integration
Infrastructure services are designed for seamless integration:
- **Cache + AI**: Automatic caching of sanitized inputs and AI responses
- **Resilience + Cache**: Circuit breakers for cache operations with fallback strategies
