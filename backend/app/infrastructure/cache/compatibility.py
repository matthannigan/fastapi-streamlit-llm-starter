"""Compatibility wrapper for maintaining backwards compatibility during cache transitions.

This module provides wrapper classes and utilities that ensure existing code
continues to work during the cache infrastructure refactoring. It acts as a
bridge between old and new cache implementations, allowing gradual migration
without breaking existing functionality.

Classes:
    CompatibilityWrapper: Main wrapper class that provides backwards compatibility
                         for existing cache interfaces while delegating to new
                         implementations internally.

Key Features:
    - Seamless integration with existing codebase during transition period
    - Method mapping between old and new cache interface signatures
    - Deprecation warnings for old patterns with migration guidance
    - Configurable compatibility modes (strict, permissive, migration)
    - Performance metrics to track usage of legacy vs new patterns
    - Automatic fallback mechanisms for unsupported operations

Example:
    ```python
    >>> # Existing code continues to work unchanged
    >>> old_cache = AIResponseCache()  # Legacy interface
    >>> wrapper = CompatibilityWrapper(
    ...     legacy_cache=old_cache,
    ...     new_cache=GenericRedisCache(),
    ...     mode="migration"  # Provides warnings but maintains compatibility
    ... )
    >>> 
    >>> # Legacy methods still work but internally use new implementation
    >>> result = await wrapper.get_ai_response(prompt_hash)
    >>> await wrapper.store_ai_response(prompt_hash, response, ttl=3600)
    ```

Note:
    This is a Phase-1 scaffolding stub. Implementation will be added in
    subsequent phases of the cache refactoring project. This wrapper is
    intended to be temporary and will be deprecated once migration is complete.

    Acts as an adapter between old and new cache implementations, ensuring

    This wrapper is designed to be a temporary bridge during the refactoring

    new cache interfaces directly.
