"""Generic Redis cache implementation providing flexible caching capabilities.

This module implements a generic Redis-backed cache that can handle various data
types and caching patterns. It extends the base cache interface with Redis-specific
functionality while maintaining compatibility with the standard cache contract.

Classes:
    GenericRedisCache: A flexible Redis cache implementation that supports
                      multiple data types, custom serialization, and advanced
                      Redis features like expiration, atomic operations, and
                      pipeline operations.

Key Features:
    - Generic data type support with automatic serialization/deserialization
    - TTL (Time To Live) management with Redis native expiration
    - Pipeline operations for batch processing
    - Atomic operations using Redis transactions
    - Connection pooling and failover support
    - Metrics and monitoring integration

Example:
    ```python
    >>> cache = GenericRedisCache(redis_url="redis://localhost:6379")
    >>> await cache.set("user:123", {"name": "John", "age": 30}, ttl=3600)
    >>> user_data = await cache.get("user:123")
    >>> await cache.delete("user:123")
    ```

Note:
    This is a Phase-1 scaffolding stub. Implementation will be added in
    subsequent phases of the cache refactoring project.
