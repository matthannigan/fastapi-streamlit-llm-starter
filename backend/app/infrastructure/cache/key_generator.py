"""Cache key generation utilities for consistent and collision-free caching.

This module provides utilities for generating consistent, hierarchical, and
collision-resistant cache keys across the application. It ensures that cache
keys follow standardized patterns and naming conventions while supporting
various data types and use cases.

Classes:
    CacheKeyGenerator: Main utility class for generating standardized cache keys
                      with support for namespacing, versioning, and collision
                      prevention through hashing and prefixing strategies.

Key Features:
    - Hierarchical key generation with namespace support
    - Collision-resistant hashing for complex data structures
    - Versioning support for cache invalidation strategies
    - Standardized prefixes and separators across the application
    - Support for various data types including objects, lists, and primitives
    - Debug-friendly key formats with optional human-readable components

Example:
    ```python
    >>> generator = CacheKeyGenerator(namespace="ai_responses")
    >>> key = generator.generate("user", user_id, "response", response_hash)
    >>> # Result: "ai_responses:user:123:response:abc123def"
    
    >>> complex_key = generator.generate_from_dict({
    ...     "model": "gpt-4",
    ...     "temperature": 0.7,
    ...     "prompt": "What is AI?"
    ... })
    >>> # Result: "ai_responses:dict:sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f6"
    ```

Note:
    This is a Phase-1 scaffolding stub. Implementation will be added in
    subsequent phases of the cache refactoring project.
