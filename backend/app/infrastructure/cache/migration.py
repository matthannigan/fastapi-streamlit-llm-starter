"""Cache migration utilities for seamless transitions between cache versions.

This module provides tools for migrating cache data and configurations when
upgrading between different cache implementations or schema versions. It ensures
data integrity and minimal downtime during cache infrastructure changes.

Classes:
    CacheMigrationManager: Orchestrates cache migrations with support for
                          rollback, validation, and progress tracking.
    MigrationConfig: Configuration dataclass for migration parameters and options.
    MigrationResult: Result dataclass containing migration outcomes and statistics.
    MigrationStrategy: Base class for defining custom migration strategies.

Key Features:
    - Seamless migration between different cache backends (Memory â†” Redis)
    - Version-aware migrations with rollback support
    - Batch processing for large datasets with progress tracking
    - Data validation and integrity checking during migration
    - Configurable migration strategies for different use cases
    - Comprehensive logging and error reporting

Example:
    ```python
    >>> config = MigrationConfig(
    ...     source_cache=memory_cache,
    ...     target_cache=redis_cache,
    ...     batch_size=1000,
    ...     validate_data=True
    ... )
    >>> manager = CacheMigrationManager(config)
    >>> result = await manager.migrate()
    >>> print(f"Migrated {result.keys_processed} keys in {result.duration}s")
    ```

Note:
    This is a Phase-1 scaffolding stub. Implementation will be added in
    subsequent phases of the cache refactoring project.
