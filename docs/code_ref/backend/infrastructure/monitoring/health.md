# Health Check Infrastructure Module

This module provides health check capabilities for monitoring the overall system status
and component availability. It implements standardized health checks that can be used
by monitoring systems, load balancers, and operational tools.

## Features

- Component health status monitoring
- Dependency availability checks
- System resource health validation
- Standardized health check responses
- Integration with external monitoring systems

## Usage

```python
from app.infrastructure.monitoring.health import HealthChecker, ComponentStatus

# Create health checker
health_checker = HealthChecker()

# Register component checks
health_checker.register_check("database", check_database_connection)
health_checker.register_check("redis", check_redis_connection)
health_checker.register_check("ai_service", check_ai_service_availability)

# Perform health check
status = await health_checker.check_health()
if status.is_healthy:
print("System is healthy")
else:
print(f"System issues: {status.failed_components}")
```

## Integration

Health checks integrate with:
- FastAPI health endpoints
- Container orchestration platforms
- Load balancer health checks
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Operational dashboards

Note: This module is currently a placeholder for future health check implementation.
The actual health check logic should be implemented based on specific system requirements.
