# Cache migration utilities for seamless transitions between cache versions.

  file_path: `backend/app/infrastructure/cache/migration.py`

This module provides tools for migrating cache data and configurations when
upgrading between different cache implementations or schema versions. It ensures
data integrity and minimal downtime during cache infrastructure changes.

## Classes

CacheMigrationManager: Orchestrates cache migrations with support for
rollback, validation, and progress tracking.
DetailedValidationResult: Comprehensive validation result with metadata.
BackupResult: Result from backup operations with file paths and statistics.
MigrationResult: Result dataclass containing migration outcomes and statistics.
RestoreResult: Result from restore operations with success metrics.

## Key Features

- Seamless migration between different cache backends (Memory â†” Redis)
- Data backup and restore with gzipped JSON format
- Chunked operations using SCAN to avoid blocking Redis
- Data validation and integrity checking during migration
- Comprehensive logging and error reporting
- Progress tracking for long-running operations

## Example

```python
```python
manager = CacheMigrationManager()
backup_result = await manager.create_backup(source_cache, "backup.json.gz")
if backup_result.success:
    migration_result = await manager.migrate_ai_cache_data(
        ai_cache, generic_cache
    )
    validation_result = await manager.validate_data_consistency(
        ai_cache, generic_cache
    )
```

## Warning

Migration operations can be long-running and resource-intensive. Always test
migrations in a development environment before running in production.
