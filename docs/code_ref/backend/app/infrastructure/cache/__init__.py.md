# Cache Infrastructure Module

  file_path: `backend/app/infrastructure/cache/__init__.py`

This module provides a comprehensive caching infrastructure with multiple implementations
and monitoring capabilities. It serves as the single point of entry for all cache-related
functionality in the application.

## Main Components

- CacheInterface: Abstract base class for all cache implementations
- AIResponseCache: Redis-based cache with compression and tiered storage
- InMemoryCache: High-performance in-memory cache with TTL and LRU eviction
- CacheKeyGenerator: Optimized cache key generation for large texts
- CachePerformanceMonitor: Comprehensive performance monitoring and analytics

## Cache Implementations

- Redis-based caching with fallback to memory-only mode
- In-memory caching with TTL and LRU eviction
- Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable

## Monitoring and Analytics

- Real-time performance metrics
- Memory usage tracking
- Compression efficiency monitoring
- Cache invalidation pattern analysis
- Automatic threshold-based alerting

## Usage Example

```python
from app.infrastructure.cache import AIResponseCache, InMemoryCache

# Redis-based cache for production
cache = AIResponseCache(redis_url="redis://localhost:6379")
await cache.connect()

# In-memory cache for development/testing
memory_cache = InMemoryCache(default_ttl=3600, max_size=1000)

# Cache an AI response
await cache.cache_response(
    text="Document to process",
    operation="summarize",
    options={"max_length": 100},
    response={"summary": "Brief summary"}
)

# Get cached response
result = await cache.get_cached_response(
    text="Document to process",
    operation="summarize",
    options={"max_length": 100}
)
```

## Configuration

The cache system supports extensive configuration for:
- TTL (Time-To-Live) settings per operation type
- Compression thresholds and levels
- Memory cache size limits
- Performance monitoring thresholds
- Redis connection settings
