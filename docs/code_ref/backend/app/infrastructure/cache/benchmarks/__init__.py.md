# Cache Performance Benchmarking Package

  file_path: `backend/app/infrastructure/cache/benchmarks/__init__.py`

This package provides a comprehensive, modular performance benchmarking infrastructure
for cache implementations. It has been refactored from a monolithic design to improve
maintainability, testability, and extensibility.

## Package Structure

models.py: Data models for benchmark results and analysis
utils.py: Statistical calculations and utility functions
generator.py: Test data generation for realistic workloads
config.py: Configuration management and environment-specific presets
reporting.py: Report generation in multiple formats
core.py: Main benchmarking orchestration and execution

The package maintains backward compatibility with the original benchmarks.py interface
while providing enhanced modularity and configuration flexibility.

## Usage

```python
from app.infrastructure.cache.benchmarks import CachePerformanceBenchmark

benchmark = CachePerformanceBenchmark()
cache = SomeCache()
result = await benchmark.benchmark_basic_operations(cache)
print(f"Performance: {result.avg_duration_ms:.2f}ms")
```

## Key Features

- Comprehensive cache operation benchmarking
- Memory usage tracking and analysis
- Compression efficiency testing
- Before/after comparison utilities
- Configurable performance thresholds
- Multiple report formats (text, JSON, markdown, CI)
- Environment-specific configuration presets
