# [REFACTORED] Comprehensive cache benchmark reporting with multi-format output and detailed analysis.

  file_path: `backend/app/infrastructure/cache/benchmarks/reporting.py`

This module provides sophisticated report generation infrastructure for cache performance benchmarks
supporting multiple output formats including human-readable text, structured JSON, GitHub-compatible
markdown, and CI/CD optimized reports with performance badges and automated insights.

## Classes

BenchmarkReporter: Abstract base class defining reporting interface with analysis utilities
TextReporter: Human-readable console/log reports with configurable verbosity levels
CIReporter: CI/CD pipeline optimized reports with badges, tables, and concise insights
JSONReporter: Structured JSON output for API integration and programmatic processing
MarkdownReporter: GitHub-flavored markdown with collapsible sections and performance tables
ReporterFactory: Factory pattern for creating appropriate reporters with auto-detection

## Key Features

- **Multi-Format Support**: Text, JSON, Markdown, and CI-specific formats with consistent
analysis across all output types for different audiences and use cases.

- **Performance Analysis**: Automated performance insights including threshold analysis,
memory efficiency assessment, success rate evaluation, and variability detection.

- **Actionable Recommendations**: Context-aware optimization recommendations based on
performance patterns, memory usage, reliability metrics, and cache efficiency.

- **CI/CD Integration**: Performance badges, GitHub Actions annotations, automated
pass/fail determination, and concise insights optimized for pipeline integration.

- **Configurable Verbosity**: Multiple detail levels from summary to comprehensive
with customizable section inclusion for different reporting needs.

- **Environment Detection**: Automatic format detection based on CI environment
variables and configuration preferences for seamless integration.

## Report Format Capabilities

**Text Reports**: Console-friendly output with sections for header, results, analysis,
recommendations, and failures. Supports summary, standard, and detailed verbosity.

**JSON Reports**: Structured data with schema versioning, computed metrics, analysis
metadata, and complete benchmark preservation for API integration.

**Markdown Reports**: GitHub-compatible format with performance tables, collapsible
details, environment information, and emoji indicators for visual clarity.

**CI Reports**: Pipeline-optimized format with performance badges, concise insights,
summary tables, and quick assessment for automated deployment decisions.

## Usage Examples

### Multi-Format Report Generation

```python
from app.infrastructure.cache.benchmarks.reporting import ReporterFactory

# Text report for console output
text_reporter = ReporterFactory.get_reporter("text")
text_report = text_reporter.generate_report(suite)
print(text_report)

# CI report with badges
ci_reporter = ReporterFactory.get_reporter("ci")
ci_report = ci_reporter.generate_report(suite)

# JSON for API integration
json_reporter = ReporterFactory.get_reporter("json")
json_report = json_reporter.generate_report(suite)
```

### Environment-Based Auto-Detection

```python
# Automatically detects CI environment
format = ReporterFactory.detect_format_from_environment()
reporter = ReporterFactory.get_reporter(format)

# Generate all formats
all_reports = ReporterFactory.generate_all_reports(suite)
for format_name, report in all_reports.items():
    with open(f"report.{format_name}", "w") as f:
        f.write(report)
```

### Custom Configuration

```python
# Detailed text report with specific sections
text_reporter = TextReporter(
    verbosity="detailed",
    include_sections=["header", "results", "analysis"]
)

# JSON with metadata inclusion
json_reporter = JSONReporter(
    include_metadata=True,
    schema_version="2.0"
)
```

## Performance Considerations

- Report generation is optimized for minimal overhead during benchmark execution
- Large dataset formatting is handled efficiently with streaming approaches
- Multiple format generation uses shared analysis to minimize computation
- Badge generation includes caching for repeated use in CI environments

## Thread Safety

All reporter classes are stateless and thread-safe for concurrent report generation.
Factory methods are safe for concurrent use across multiple benchmark executions.
