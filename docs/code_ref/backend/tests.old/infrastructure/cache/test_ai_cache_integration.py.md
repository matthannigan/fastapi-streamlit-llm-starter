# Comprehensive Integration Testing Framework for AI Cache System with Preset Integration

  file_path: `backend/tests.old/infrastructure/cache/test_ai_cache_integration.py`

This module provides end-to-end integration tests for the AI cache system,
validating the complete interaction between AIResponseCache, configuration management,
parameter mapping, monitoring systems, and the new preset system. Tests ensure the cache
system works correctly as an integrated whole with proper inheritance patterns.

## Test Coverage

- End-to-end cache workflows with various text sizes and operations
- Inheritance method delegation from GenericRedisCache
- AI-specific invalidation patterns and behavior
- Memory cache promotion logic and LRU behavior
- Configuration integration and validation with preset system
- Monitoring integration and metrics collection
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Performance benchmarks and security validation
- Preset-based environment setup and configuration

## Architecture

- Uses async/await patterns consistently
- Handles Redis unavailability gracefully with memory cache fallback
- Tests both positive and negative scenarios with preset configurations
- Provides comprehensive error reporting
- Follows pytest async testing patterns

## Dependencies

- pytest-asyncio for async test execution
- AIResponseCache and supporting infrastructure
- Configuration management systems with preset support
- Performance monitoring framework
