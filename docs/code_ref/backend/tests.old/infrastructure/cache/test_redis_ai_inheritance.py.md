# Comprehensive tests for AIResponseCache inheritance implementation.

  file_path: `backend/tests.old/infrastructure/cache/test_redis_ai_inheritance.py`

This module tests the refactored AIResponseCache that inherits from GenericRedisCache,
focusing on the method overrides and AI-specific enhancements implemented in
Phase 2 Deliverable 3.

## Test Coverage Areas

- AI-specific method overrides (cache_response, get_cached_response, invalidate_by_operation)
- Helper methods for text tier determination and operation extraction
- Memory cache promotion logic
- AI metrics collection and recording
- Error handling and validation
- Integration with inherited GenericRedisCache functionality
