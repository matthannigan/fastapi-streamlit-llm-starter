# Comprehensive unit tests for InMemoryCache implementation following docstring-driven development.

  file_path: `backend/tests.old/unit/infrastructure/cache/take1/test_memory.py`

This test module verifies the core behavior and contracts defined in the InMemoryCache docstrings,
focusing on observable behavior rather than implementation details. Tests cover TTL expiration,
LRU eviction, statistics monitoring, and async safety per the documented contracts.

## Test Classes

TestInMemoryCacheBasics: Core cache operations (get, set, delete, exists)
TestInMemoryCacheTTL: Time-to-live expiration behavior and cleanup
TestInMemoryCacheLRU: LRU eviction policy and capacity management
TestInMemoryCacheStatistics: Monitoring and statistics features
TestInMemoryCacheEdgeCases: Error handling and boundary conditions
TestInMemoryCacheAsync: Async behavior and concurrent access patterns

Coverage Target: >90% (infrastructure requirement)
Focus: Test behavior contracts from docstrings, not internal implementation
