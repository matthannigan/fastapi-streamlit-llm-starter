# Unit tests for AI Response Cache configuration module following docstring-driven test development.

  file_path: `backend/tests.old/unit/infrastructure/cache/take1/test_ai_config.py`

This test suite validates the comprehensive AI cache configuration system including
parameter validation, factory methods, environment integration, and configuration
management features that support the cache inheritance architecture.

## Test Coverage Areas

- AIResponseCacheConfig initialization and default values per docstrings
- Configuration validation with ValidationResult integration
- Factory methods for different deployment scenarios
- Environment variable loading and parsing
- Configuration merging and inheritance
- Parameter conversion methods for cache initialization
- Edge cases and error handling documented in method docstrings

## Business Critical

AI cache configuration failures would prevent proper cache initialization and
inheritance from GenericRedisCache, directly impacting AI service performance
and reliability across different deployment environments.

## Test Strategy

- Unit tests for individual configuration methods per docstring contracts
- Integration tests for complete configuration workflows
- Edge case coverage for invalid configurations and parsing errors
- Behavior verification based on documented examples and use cases
