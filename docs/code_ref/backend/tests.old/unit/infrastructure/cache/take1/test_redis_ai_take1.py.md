# Comprehensive unit tests for AIResponseCache following docstring-driven test development.

  file_path: `backend/tests.old/unit/infrastructure/cache/take1/test_redis_ai_take1.py`

This module implements behavior-focused tests that validate the documented contracts
of AIResponseCache methods, focusing on AI-specific caching functionality while
ensuring proper mocking to avoid external Redis dependencies.

## Test Coverage Areas

- AIResponseCache initialization and parameter validation
- AI-specific cache operations (cache_response, get_cached_response)
- Text tier categorization and intelligent key generation
- AI metrics collection and performance monitoring
- Graceful degradation and error handling patterns
- Edge cases: large responses, connection failures, memory fallbacks

## Business Impact

These tests ensure the AI cache infrastructure provides reliable caching for
expensive LLM operations while maintaining data consistency and performance.
Test failures indicate potential issues with AI response storage/retrieval
that could impact user experience and system performance.

## Architecture Focus

Tests the refactored inheritance model where AIResponseCache extends
GenericRedisCache with AI-specific functionality while maintaining clean
separation of concerns and proper error handling patterns.
