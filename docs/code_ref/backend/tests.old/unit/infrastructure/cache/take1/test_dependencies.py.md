# Comprehensive unit tests for FastAPI cache dependency injection system.

  file_path: `backend/tests.old/unit/infrastructure/cache/take1/test_dependencies.py`

This module tests all cache dependency injection components following docstring-driven
test development methodology. Tests verify documented contracts in Args, Returns,
Raises, and Behavior sections, focusing on WHAT should happen rather than HOW
it's implemented.

The cache dependencies module provides comprehensive FastAPI dependency injection for
cache services with lifecycle management, thread-safe registry, and health monitoring.
Tests validate proper dependency management, service construction, graceful degradation,
and integration with the FastAPI dependency injection framework.

## Test Classes

- TestCacheDependencyManager: Core dependency manager for cache lifecycle and registry
- TestSettingsDependencies: Settings and configuration dependency providers
- TestMainCacheDependencies: Primary cache service dependencies with factory integration
- TestSpecializedCacheDependencies: Web and AI optimized cache dependencies
- TestTestingDependencies: Testing-specific cache dependencies
- TestUtilityDependencies: Validation, conditional, and fallback dependencies
- TestLifecycleManagement: Registry cleanup and cache disconnection
- TestHealthCheckDependencies: Comprehensive health monitoring dependencies
- TestDependencyIntegration: Integration testing across dependency chains

## Coverage Requirements

>90% coverage for infrastructure modules per project standards

## Testing Philosophy

- Test WHAT should happen per docstring contracts
- Focus on dependency injection behavior, not cache implementation
- Mock external dependencies (CacheFactory, Redis, settings) appropriately
- Test registry management, thread safety, and lifecycle behaviors
- Validate graceful degradation and error handling patterns
- Test integration with FastAPI dependency injection framework

## Business Impact

These tests ensure reliable cache service provisioning for web applications,
preventing cache-related outages that could impact user experience and system
performance. Proper dependency management is critical for application stability.
