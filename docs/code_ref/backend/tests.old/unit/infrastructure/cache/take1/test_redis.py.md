# [UNIT TESTS] Redis Legacy Cache Implementation - Comprehensive Docstring-Driven Tests

  file_path: `backend/tests.old/unit/infrastructure/cache/take1/test_redis.py`

This test module provides comprehensive unit tests for the deprecated AIResponseCache class
in app.infrastructure.cache.redis, following docstring-driven test development principles.
The tests focus on the documented contracts in the AIResponseCache class docstrings,
testing WHAT the cache should do rather than HOW it implements the functionality.

## Test Structure

- TestAIResponseCacheInitialization: Constructor behavior and configuration
- TestAIResponseCacheConnection: Redis connection handling and fallback logic
- TestAIResponseCacheKeyGeneration: Cache key generation and text handling
- TestAIResponseCacheRetrieval: Cache retrieval with tiered fallback strategy
- TestAIResponseCacheCaching: Response caching with compression and TTL
- TestAIResponseCacheInvalidation: Pattern-based and operation-specific invalidation
- TestAIResponseCacheStatistics: Performance statistics and memory monitoring
- TestAIResponseCacheErrorHandling: Error scenarios and graceful degradation
- TestAIResponseCachePerformanceMonitoring: Performance monitoring integration
- TestAIResponseCacheMemoryManagement: Memory cache management and eviction

## Business Impact

These tests ensure the deprecated Redis cache maintains backward compatibility
while validating the documented behavior for systems still using this interface.
The tests prevent regressions during the transition to the new modular cache structure.

## Test Coverage Focus

- Cache contract fulfillment per documented behavior
- Redis connection handling with graceful degradation
- Tiered caching strategy (memory + Redis)
- Compression logic for large responses
- TTL handling per operation type
- Pattern-based invalidation with performance tracking
- Performance monitoring integration
- Error handling and fallback behavior

## Mocking Strategy

- Mock Redis client connections to avoid external dependencies
- Mock CachePerformanceMonitor for isolated performance tracking
- Mock CacheKeyGenerator for predictable key generation
- Test actual cache logic while mocking Redis interactions
- Use real objects for business logic validation

## Architecture Note

This module tests the deprecated AIResponseCache which inherits from GenericRedisCache
but adds AI-specific functionality. Tests focus on the AI-specific behavior documented
in the class docstrings while ensuring the inheritance relationship works correctly.
