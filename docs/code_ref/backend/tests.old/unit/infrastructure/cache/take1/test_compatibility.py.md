# Comprehensive unit tests for cache compatibility wrapper system.

  file_path: `backend/tests.old/unit/infrastructure/cache/take1/test_compatibility.py`

This module tests all compatibility components following docstring-driven
test development methodology. Tests verify documented contracts in Args, Returns,
Raises, and Behavior sections, focusing on WHAT should happen rather than HOW
it's implemented.

## Test Classes

- TestCacheCompatibilityWrapperInitialization: Wrapper initialization and configuration
- TestCacheCompatibilityWrapperAttributeAccess: Dynamic attribute proxying to inner cache
- TestCacheCompatibilityWrapperDeprecationWarnings: Deprecation warning system behavior
- TestCacheCompatibilityWrapperLegacyMethods: Legacy method compatibility and forwarding
- TestCacheCompatibilityWrapperEdgeCases: Error handling and boundary conditions
- TestCacheCompatibilityWrapperIntegration: Integration with various cache implementations

## Coverage Requirements

>90% coverage for infrastructure modules per project standards

## Testing Philosophy

- Test WHAT should happen per docstring contracts
- Focus on behavior verification, not implementation details
- Mock only external dependencies (warnings, logging, AsyncMock detection)
- Test edge cases and error conditions documented in docstrings
- Validate backwards compatibility and migration support during refactoring
- Test behavioral equivalence between legacy and new cache patterns
