# Comprehensive unit tests for cache presets configuration system.

  file_path: `backend/tests.old/unit/infrastructure/cache/take1/test_cache_presets.py`

This module tests all cache preset components following docstring-driven
test development methodology. Tests verify documented contracts in Args, Returns,
Raises, and Behavior sections, focusing on WHAT should happen rather than HOW
it's implemented.

## Test Classes

- TestEnvironmentRecommendation: Named tuple for environment-based recommendations
- TestCacheStrategy: Cache strategy enumeration and string serialization
- TestCacheConfig: Local cache configuration with validation and conversion
- TestCachePreset: Preset dataclass with conversion and validation methods
- TestCachePresetManager: Manager with environment detection and recommendations
- TestUtilityFunctions: Default presets generation and global manager access
- TestCachePresetsIntegration: Integration between presets and external config system

## Coverage Requirements

>90% coverage for infrastructure modules per project standards

## Testing Philosophy

- Test WHAT should happen per docstring contracts
- Focus on behavior verification, not implementation details
- Mock only external dependencies (environment variables, file system, cache_validator)
- Test edge cases and error conditions documented in docstrings
- Validate preset system integration with cache_validator when available
