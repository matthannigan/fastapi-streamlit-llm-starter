# Comprehensive unit tests for cache factory system with explicit cache instantiation.

  file_path: `backend/tests.old/unit/infrastructure/cache/take1/test_factory.py`

This module tests all cache factory components following docstring-driven
test development methodology. Tests verify documented contracts in Args, Returns,
Raises, and Behavior sections, focusing on WHAT should happen rather than HOW
it's implemented.

The cache factory provides deterministic cache creation for different use cases,
replacing auto-detection patterns with explicit configuration. Tests validate
proper factory pattern implementation, cache construction workflows, input
validation, error handling, and graceful fallback behaviors.

## Test Classes

- TestCacheFactoryInitialization: Factory initialization and monitoring setup
- TestFactoryInputValidation: Comprehensive input validation for all factory methods
- TestWebAppCacheFactory: Web application cache creation with balanced performance
- TestAIAppCacheFactory: AI application cache creation with enhanced storage
- TestTestingCacheFactory: Testing-optimized cache creation with short TTLs
- TestConfigBasedCacheFactory: Configuration-driven cache creation
- TestFactoryErrorHandling: Error handling and graceful degradation patterns
- TestFactoryIntegration: Integration testing across factory methods and cache types

## Coverage Requirements

>90% coverage for infrastructure modules per project standards

## Testing Philosophy

- Test WHAT should happen per docstring contracts
- Focus on factory behavior verification, not cache implementation details
- Mock external dependencies (Redis, CachePerformanceMonitor, cache classes) appropriately
- Test input validation, configuration mapping, and error handling patterns
- Validate factory method selection logic and parameter passing
- Test graceful fallback to InMemoryCache when Redis unavailable

## Business Impact

These tests ensure reliable cache factory operation for deterministic cache
instantiation across different application types. Factory failures could impact
cache availability, leading to performance degradation and potential service
outages. Proper factory testing prevents cache misconfiguration issues.
