# Unit tests for the CacheInterface abstract base class.

  file_path: `backend/tests.old/unit/infrastructure/cache/take1/test_base.py`

This module tests the abstract cache interface contract and ensures proper
abstraction behavior for all cache implementations. Tests focus on interface
correctness, abstract method enforcement, and polymorphic usage patterns.

## Test Coverage

- Abstract class instantiation prevention
- Abstract method enforcement (get, set, delete)
- Type hints and interface contracts
- Concrete implementation requirement validation
- Polymorphic usage patterns

## Business Impact

The CacheInterface ensures consistent behavior across different caching
backends, enabling reliable polymorphic usage throughout the application.
These tests verify that the interface contract is properly enforced.
