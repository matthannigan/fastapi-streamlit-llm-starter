# Unit tests for the CacheInterface abstract base class.

  file_path: `backend/tests.old/unit/infrastructure/cache/take1/test_base.py`

This module tests the abstract cache interface contract and ensures proper
abstraction behavior for all cache implementations. Tests focus on interface
correctness, abstract method enforcement, and polymorphic usage patterns.

Test Coverage:
    - Abstract class instantiation prevention
    - Abstract method enforcement (get, set, delete)
    - Type hints and interface contracts
    - Concrete implementation requirement validation
    - Polymorphic usage patterns

Business Impact:
    The CacheInterface ensures consistent behavior across different caching
    backends, enabling reliable polymorphic usage throughout the application.
    These tests verify that the interface contract is properly enforced.

## TestCacheInterfaceAbstractBehavior

Test suite for CacheInterface abstract class behavior and contract enforcement.

Scope:
    - Abstract class instantiation prevention
    - Abstract method requirement validation
    - Interface contract verification
    - Type signature compliance
    
Business Critical:
    Interface contract failures would break polymorphic cache usage throughout
    the application, causing runtime errors and inconsistent behavior.
    
Test Strategy:
    - Unit tests for abstract behavior verification
    - Mock concrete implementations to test interface compliance
    - Type checking validation for method signatures
    - Contract enforcement testing
    
Infrastructure Impact:
    All cache implementations depend on this interface for consistent behavior.
    Failures here would affect memory cache, Redis cache, and future implementations.
