# Unit tests for the GenericRedisCache class following docstring-driven test development.

  file_path: `backend/tests.old/unit/infrastructure/cache/take1/test_redis_generic.py`

This test module comprehensively validates the GenericRedisCache implementation
by testing the documented contracts from class and method docstrings. Each test
focuses on specific behavior guarantees documented in the source code.

## Test Coverage Areas

1. Connection Management: Redis connection establishment, failures, and reconnection
2. Cache Operations: Basic get/set/delete operations with various data types
3. L1 Memory Cache Integration: Two-tier caching behavior and synchronization
4. Data Serialization: JSON fast-path, pickle serialization, and compression
5. TTL and Expiration: Time-to-live management and automatic expiration
6. Error Handling: Graceful degradation and Redis unavailability scenarios
7. Performance Monitoring: Integration with CachePerformanceMonitor
8. Callback System: Event-driven callback registration and execution
9. Security Features: Secure connection management and validation
10. Memory Management: Memory usage tracking and threshold alerting

## Business Impact

These tests ensure the Redis cache provides reliable, high-performance caching
capabilities that gracefully handle infrastructure failures while maintaining
data consistency and performance monitoring for production environments.

## Testing Philosophy

- Test documented behavior contracts from docstrings (Args, Returns, Raises, Behavior)
- Mock Redis connections to avoid external dependencies
- Focus on generic caching patterns rather than Redis implementation details
- Validate error handling and graceful degradation scenarios
- Ensure thread safety and async operation correctness
