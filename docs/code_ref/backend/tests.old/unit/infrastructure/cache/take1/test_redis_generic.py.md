# Unit tests for the GenericRedisCache class following docstring-driven test development.

  file_path: `backend/tests.old/unit/infrastructure/cache/take1/test_redis_generic.py`

This test module comprehensively validates the GenericRedisCache implementation
by testing the documented contracts from class and method docstrings. Each test
focuses on specific behavior guarantees documented in the source code.

Test Coverage Areas:
    1. Connection Management: Redis connection establishment, failures, and reconnection
    2. Cache Operations: Basic get/set/delete operations with various data types
    3. L1 Memory Cache Integration: Two-tier caching behavior and synchronization
    4. Data Serialization: JSON fast-path, pickle serialization, and compression
    5. TTL and Expiration: Time-to-live management and automatic expiration
    6. Error Handling: Graceful degradation and Redis unavailability scenarios
    7. Performance Monitoring: Integration with CachePerformanceMonitor
    8. Callback System: Event-driven callback registration and execution
    9. Security Features: Secure connection management and validation
    10. Memory Management: Memory usage tracking and threshold alerting

Business Impact:
    These tests ensure the Redis cache provides reliable, high-performance caching
    capabilities that gracefully handle infrastructure failures while maintaining
    data consistency and performance monitoring for production environments.

Testing Philosophy:
    - Test documented behavior contracts from docstrings (Args, Returns, Raises, Behavior)
    - Mock Redis connections to avoid external dependencies
    - Focus on generic caching patterns rather than Redis implementation details
    - Validate error handling and graceful degradation scenarios
    - Ensure thread safety and async operation correctness
