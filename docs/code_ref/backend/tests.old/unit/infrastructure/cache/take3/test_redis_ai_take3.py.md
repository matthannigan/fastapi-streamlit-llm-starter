# Comprehensive unit tests for AIResponseCache following behavior-driven testing principles.

  file_path: `backend/tests.old/unit/infrastructure/cache/take3/test_redis_ai_take3.py`

This test suite focuses exclusively on testing the observable behaviors documented
in the AIResponseCache public contract (redis_ai.pyi). Tests are organized by
behavior rather than implementation details, following the principle of testing
what the code should accomplish from an external observer's perspective.

## Test Categories

- Initialization behavior and parameter validation
- Cache storage and retrieval operations
- Cache invalidation and clearing operations
- Performance monitoring and statistics
- Error handling and exception behavior
- Legacy compatibility features

All tests mock external dependencies at system boundaries only, focusing on
the behaviors documented in the docstrings rather than internal implementation.
