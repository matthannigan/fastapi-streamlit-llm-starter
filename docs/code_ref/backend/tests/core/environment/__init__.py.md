# Test suite for backend.app.core.environment module.

  file_path: `backend/tests/core/environment/__init__.py`

This module tests the unified environment detection service that provides
centralized environment classification across all backend infrastructure
services including cache, resilience, security, and monitoring systems.

Test Architecture:
    - Tests focus exclusively on public API contracts from environment.pyi
    - Uses behavior-driven testing focused on observable outcomes
    - Mocks only external system dependencies (os.getenv, file system)
    - Tests confidence scoring, feature contexts, and fallback detection
    - Validates thread safety and performance optimization patterns

Coverage Areas:
    - Environment detection with various signal sources
    - Feature-specific context handling and overrides
    - Configuration customization and pattern matching
    - Confidence scoring and conflict resolution
    - Fallback strategies and error handling
    - Module-level convenience functions
