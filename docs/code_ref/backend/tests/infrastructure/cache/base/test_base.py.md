# Unit tests for CacheInterface abstract base class.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/base/test_base.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
CacheInterface public contract (base.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- Infrastructure service (>90% test coverage requirement)
- Abstract interface contract enforcement
- Polymorphic usage patterns across different implementations
- Async method signature compliance

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
