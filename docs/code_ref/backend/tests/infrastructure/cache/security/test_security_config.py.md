# Unit tests for SecurityConfig initialization and validation behavior.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/security/test_security_config.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
SecurityConfig public contract (security.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- SecurityConfig initialization and parameter validation
- Security level assessment and configuration validation
- Certificate path validation and TLS configuration
- Authentication configuration validation and security properties

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
