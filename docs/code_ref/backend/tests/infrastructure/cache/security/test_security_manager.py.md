# Unit tests for RedisCacheSecurityManager secure connection and validation behavior.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/security/test_security_manager.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
RedisCacheSecurityManager public contract (security.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- create_secure_connection() method behavior with various security configurations
- validate_connection_security() method comprehensive security assessment
- Security reporting and recommendation generation
- Connection retry logic and error handling for security failures

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
