# Unit tests for EnvironmentPresets and preset system integration.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/config/test_environment_presets.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
EnvironmentPresets public contract (config.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- EnvironmentPresets static methods for various environment configurations
- Preset system integration with new cache preset architecture
- Preset recommendation logic and environment detection
- Preset configuration validation and optimization

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
