# Unit tests for CacheConfigBuilder fluent interface and configuration building.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/config/test_config_builder.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
CacheConfigBuilder public contract (config.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- CacheConfigBuilder fluent interface and method chaining
- Environment-based configuration loading and file operations
- Validation integration and error handling during building
- Configuration building and finalization through build() method

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
