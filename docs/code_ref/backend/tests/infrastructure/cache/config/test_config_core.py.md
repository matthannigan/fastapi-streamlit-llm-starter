# Unit tests for CacheConfig and ValidationResult core functionality.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/config/test_config_core.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
CacheConfig and ValidationResult public contracts (config.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- CacheConfig initialization and validation behavior
- ValidationResult creation and error/warning management
- Configuration serialization and dictionary conversion
- Post-initialization hooks and environment loading

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
