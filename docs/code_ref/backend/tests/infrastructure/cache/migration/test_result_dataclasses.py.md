# Unit tests for migration result dataclasses.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/migration/test_result_dataclasses.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
migration result dataclasses (migration.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- Result dataclass property calculations and methods
- Statistical accuracy and computation reliability
- Data validation and boundary condition handling
- Result interpretation and business logic validation

## External Dependencies

No external dependencies - testing pure dataclass functionality and calculations.
