# Unit tests for CacheMigrationManager cache migration orchestration.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/migration/test_migration_manager.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
CacheMigrationManager public contract (migration.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- Infrastructure service (>90% test coverage requirement)
- Behavior verification per docstring specifications
- Migration orchestration and data integrity
- Performance monitoring and progress tracking

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
