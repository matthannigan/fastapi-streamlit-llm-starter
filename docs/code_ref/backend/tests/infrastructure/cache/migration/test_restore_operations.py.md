# Unit tests for CacheMigrationManager restore operations.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/migration/test_restore_operations.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
CacheMigrationManager restore methods (migration.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- Backup restoration to cache implementations
- Data integrity preservation during restore operations
- Overwrite protection and recovery handling
- Performance optimization during large restore operations

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
