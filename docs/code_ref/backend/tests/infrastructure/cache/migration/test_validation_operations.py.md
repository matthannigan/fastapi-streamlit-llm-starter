# Unit tests for CacheMigrationManager validation operations.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/migration/test_validation_operations.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
CacheMigrationManager validation methods (migration.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- Data consistency validation between cache implementations
- Comprehensive validation statistics and reporting
- Sample-based validation for large datasets
- Performance optimization during validation operations

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
