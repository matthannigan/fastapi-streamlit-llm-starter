# Unit tests for cache dependency lifecycle management and health monitoring.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/dependencies/test_lifecycle_and_health.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
cache dependencies public contract (dependencies.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- CacheDependencyManager registry cleanup and lifecycle management
- cleanup_cache_registry() function behavior and resource management
- get_cache_health_status() health monitoring and ping() method support
- validate_cache_configuration() validation dependency behavior

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
