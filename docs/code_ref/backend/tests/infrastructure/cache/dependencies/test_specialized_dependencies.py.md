# Unit tests for specialized cache service dependency functions.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/dependencies/test_specialized_dependencies.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
cache dependencies public contract (dependencies.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- get_web_cache_service() web-optimized cache dependency
- get_ai_cache_service() AI-optimized cache dependency
- get_test_cache() and get_test_redis_cache() testing dependencies
- get_fallback_cache_service() and conditional cache dependencies

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
