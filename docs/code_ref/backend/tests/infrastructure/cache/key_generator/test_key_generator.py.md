# Unit tests for CacheKeyGenerator optimized key generation.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/key_generator/test_key_generator.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
CacheKeyGenerator public contract (key_generator.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- Infrastructure service (>90% test coverage requirement)
- Behavior verification per docstring specifications
- Key generation consistency and collision avoidance
- Performance monitoring integration and metrics collection

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
