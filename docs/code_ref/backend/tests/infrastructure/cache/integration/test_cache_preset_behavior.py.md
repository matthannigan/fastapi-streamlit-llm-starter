# Verify Preset-Driven Behavioral Differences

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/integration/test_cache_preset_behavior.py`

This module provides integration tests that verify preset configurations result in
observable behavioral differences, validating the cache preset system provides
meaningful configuration distinctions rather than just parameter variations.

Focus on testing behavioral outcomes visible through the public API rather than
internal configuration details. Tests handle Redis fallback scenarios where
Redis is unavailable and factory creates InMemoryCache.

## TestCachePresetBehavior

Test suite for verifying preset-driven behavioral differences.

Integration Scope:
    Tests cache factory creating different cache types based on presets
    and verifies those caches exhibit observably different behaviors.

Business Impact:
    Ensures preset system delivers meaningful behavioral differences
    rather than just configuration parameter variations.

Test Strategy:
    - Compare AI vs generic cache key generation patterns
    - Verify operation-specific TTL behavior differences
    - Test text hashing threshold behavioral differences
    - Validate preset-driven cache type selection

### cache_factory()

```python
def cache_factory(self):
```

Create a cache factory for preset-based cache creation.

### test_factory_method_behavioral_differences()

```python
async def test_factory_method_behavioral_differences(self, cache_factory):
```

Test that different factory methods produce observably different behaviors.

Behavior Under Test:
    AI factory method should attempt to create AIResponseCache with AI features,
    while web factory method creates GenericRedisCache. When Redis unavailable,
    both fall back to InMemoryCache but retain different configurations.

Business Impact:
    Verifies factory methods provide appropriate cache configurations
    for different application types, even when infrastructure fallback occurs.

Success Criteria:
    - AI factory method creates cache configured for AI workloads
    - Web factory method creates cache configured for web applications  
    - Different TTL defaults demonstrate different factory behaviors
    - Graceful degradation handling works for both factory types

### test_testing_cache_isolation_behavior()

```python
async def test_testing_cache_isolation_behavior(self, cache_factory):
```

Test that testing factory method creates isolated cache behavior.

Behavior Under Test:
    Testing factory method should create InMemoryCache when use_memory_cache=True,
    providing predictable testing behavior without external dependencies.

Business Impact:
    Ensures testing infrastructure provides reliable, isolated cache
    behavior for consistent test execution across environments.

Success Criteria:
    - Testing factory creates InMemoryCache when requested
    - Cache supports basic operations for testing scenarios
    - Multiple test caches remain isolated from each other

### test_cache_configuration_parameter_acceptance()

```python
async def test_cache_configuration_parameter_acceptance(self, cache_factory):
```

Test that factory methods accept different configuration parameters.

Behavior Under Test:
    Different factory methods should accept their intended configuration
    parameters and create appropriately configured cache instances.

Business Impact:
    Ensures factory methods provide proper configuration interfaces
    for different application requirements.

Success Criteria:
    - AI factory accepts AI-specific parameters like operation_ttls
    - Web factory accepts web-specific parameters  
    - Testing factory accepts testing-specific parameters
    - All factories create working cache instances

### test_graceful_degradation_behavior_differences()

```python
async def test_graceful_degradation_behavior_differences(self, cache_factory):
```

Test that different factory methods provide graceful degradation consistently.

Behavior Under Test:
    All factory methods should gracefully handle Redis unavailability
    by falling back to InMemoryCache while preserving their intended
    configuration characteristics.

Business Impact:
    Ensures application remains functional even when Redis infrastructure
    is unavailable, providing consistent behavior across factory types.

Success Criteria:
    - All factory methods successfully create working cache instances
    - Fallback caches maintain basic functionality
    - Different factory methods create isolated cache instances
    - Cache operations work correctly after fallback

### test_preset_configuration_behavioral_differences()

```python
async def test_preset_configuration_behavioral_differences(self):
```

Test that preset configurations provide meaningful behavioral differences.

Behavior Under Test:
    Different presets should provide observably different configuration
    values that would result in different cache behavior if Redis were available.

Business Impact:
    Validates that preset system provides meaningful configuration
    differences for different deployment environments and use cases.

Success Criteria:
    - Development and production presets have different TTL values
    - AI presets include AI-specific configuration
    - Generic presets exclude AI-specific configuration
    - Presets provide environment-appropriate defaults
