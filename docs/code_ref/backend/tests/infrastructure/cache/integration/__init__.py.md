# Integration tests for cache infrastructure components.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/integration/__init__.py`

This package contains integration tests that verify cross-component interactions
using real implementations rather than extensive mocking. These tests demonstrate
behavior-driven testing principles with actual component integration.
