# Test Lifecycle and Health Check Dependencies

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/integration/test_cache_lifecycle_health.py`

This module provides integration tests for cache lifecycle and health check dependencies,
validating the critical application integration points for FastAPI startup, shutdown,
and health monitoring reliability.

Focus on testing observable behaviors through public dependency interfaces rather than
internal implementation details. Tests validate the contracts defined in 
backend/contracts/infrastructure/cache/dependencies.pyi for production confidence.

Since these are contract-based tests, we test the expected behaviors as specified
in the public interface contracts without importing implementation details.

## TestCacheLifecycleHealth

Test suite for verifying cache lifecycle and health dependency behaviors.

Integration Scope:
    Tests cache dependency functions that integrate the cache with FastAPI
    application lifecycle, focusing on startup, shutdown, and health monitoring.

Business Impact:
    Ensures application reliability during startup, graceful shutdown handling,
    and accurate health status reporting for production operations.

Test Strategy:
    - Test health check dependency with connected and disconnected caches
    - Verify cleanup dependency properly manages cache registry
    - Test lifecycle integration points with realistic scenarios
    - Validate dependency behavior under various cache states

### cache_factory()

```python
def cache_factory(self):
```

Create a cache factory for test cache creation.

### test_health_check_dependency_with_healthy_cache()

```python
async def test_health_check_dependency_with_healthy_cache(self, cache_factory):
```

Test health check dependency reports healthy status for connected cache.

Behavior Under Test:
    get_cache_health_status dependency should return status "healthy" 
    when given a properly connected and functional cache instance.

Business Impact:
    Ensures health endpoints correctly report when cache infrastructure
    is functioning properly, enabling reliable monitoring and alerting.

Success Criteria:
    - Health status contains "status": "healthy" field
    - Health status includes cache type information
    - Health status provides meaningful diagnostic data
    - Health check completes without errors

### test_health_check_dependency_with_degraded_cache()

```python
async def test_health_check_dependency_with_degraded_cache(self):
```

Test health check dependency reports degraded status for problematic cache.

Behavior Under Test:
    get_cache_health_status dependency should detect and report when
    cache is not functioning properly, returning appropriate status.

Business Impact:
    Ensures health endpoints can detect cache infrastructure problems
    and alert operations teams to degraded service conditions.

Success Criteria:
    - Health status reflects degraded or unhealthy state
    - Health status provides diagnostic information about the problem
    - Health check handles cache errors gracefully
    - Status differentiation allows for operational decision-making

### test_cleanup_dependency_empties_cache_registry()

```python
async def test_cleanup_dependency_empties_cache_registry(self, cache_factory):
```

Test cleanup dependency properly clears the cache registry.

Behavior Under Test:
    cleanup_cache_registry dependency should disconnect active caches
    and clear the internal registry to prevent resource leaks during shutdown.

Business Impact:
    Ensures graceful application shutdown without resource leaks,
    preventing memory issues and connection pool exhaustion.

Success Criteria:
    - Registry is properly cleared after cleanup
    - Active cache connections are handled appropriately
    - Cleanup returns meaningful statistics
    - Multiple cache instances are handled correctly

### test_dependency_manager_registry_cleanup()

```python
async def test_dependency_manager_registry_cleanup(self):
```

Test dependency manager registry cleanup functionality.

Behavior Under Test:
    CacheDependencyManager.cleanup_registry should provide registry
    cleanup functionality that can be called independently for testing.

Business Impact:
    Provides testable registry management that can be validated
    independently of full dependency injection lifecycle.

Success Criteria:
    - Manager cleanup method is callable
    - Cleanup returns appropriate result structure
    - Registry state is properly managed

### test_cache_service_dependency_integration()

```python
async def test_cache_service_dependency_integration(self):
```

Test cache service dependency integration with lifecycle management.

Behavior Under Test:
    get_cache_service dependency should integrate properly with the
    dependency injection system and provide working cache instances.

Business Impact:
    Ensures cache dependency injection works correctly in FastAPI
    application context, providing reliable cache access to endpoints.

Success Criteria:
    - Cache service can be obtained via dependency
    - Cache service is functional for basic operations
    - Dependency handles configuration appropriately
    - Multiple calls return appropriate cache instances

### test_test_cache_dependency_isolation()

```python
async def test_test_cache_dependency_isolation(self):
```

Test test cache dependency provides proper isolation.

Behavior Under Test:
    get_test_cache dependency should provide isolated cache instances
    suitable for testing without external dependencies.

Business Impact:
    Ensures testing infrastructure provides reliable, isolated cache
    behavior for consistent test execution across environments.

Success Criteria:
    - Test cache dependency returns working cache
    - Test cache is isolated from other instances
    - Test cache supports basic operations
    - Multiple test cache calls work correctly

### test_health_status_comprehensive_reporting()

```python
async def test_health_status_comprehensive_reporting(self, cache_factory):
```

Test health status provides comprehensive diagnostic information.

Behavior Under Test:
    Health status should provide detailed information useful for
    operations and debugging, not just a simple status flag.

Business Impact:
    Enables effective monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting of
    cache infrastructure in production environments.

Success Criteria:
    - Health status includes multiple diagnostic fields
    - Status information is actionable for operations
    - Health check performance is reasonable
    - Different cache states produce different diagnostic info

### test_lifecycle_integration_robustness()

```python
async def test_lifecycle_integration_robustness(self, cache_factory):
```

Test lifecycle integration handles various scenarios robustly.

Behavior Under Test:
    Cache lifecycle dependencies should handle edge cases and
    error conditions gracefully without breaking application startup.

Business Impact:
    Ensures application can start and operate even when cache
    infrastructure has problems, maintaining service availability.

Success Criteria:
    - Dependencies handle None cache instances gracefully
    - Error conditions don't prevent dependency resolution
    - Cleanup works even with partially initialized state
    - Health checks work across different cache states
