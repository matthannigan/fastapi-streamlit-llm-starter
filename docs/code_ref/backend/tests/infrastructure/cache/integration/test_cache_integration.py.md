# Integration tests for cache infrastructure components.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/integration/test_cache_integration.py`

This test suite verifies cross-component interactions using real implementations
instead of extensive mocking. Tests demonstrate how different cache components
work together to provide complete functionality.

Coverage Focus:
    - Factory + Cache + Monitor integration
    - Settings + Factory integration  
    - Cache + Key Generator + Performance Monitor integration
    - End-to-end cache workflows with real components

External Dependencies:
    Uses real components with graceful degradation for Redis unavailability.
    No internal mocking - only system boundary mocking where necessary.

## TestCacheFactoryIntegration

Integration tests for CacheFactory with other components.

Tests real component interactions rather than mocked dependencies.

### test_factory_creates_cache_with_monitoring_integration()

```python
async def test_factory_creates_cache_with_monitoring_integration(self):
```

Test complete factory workflow with performance monitoring integration.

Verifies:
    Factory creates cache with real monitoring component integration
    
Business Impact:
    Ensures end-to-end monitoring functionality works correctly
    
Integration Points:
    - CacheFactory -> Cache creation
    - Cache -> Performance monitoring integration
    - Monitor -> Metrics collection during operations

### test_factory_with_settings_creates_configured_cache()

```python
async def test_factory_with_settings_creates_configured_cache(self, test_settings):
```

Test factory integration with real Settings configuration.

Verifies:
    Factory respects actual configuration from Settings
    
Integration Points:
    - Settings -> Configuration loading
    - Factory -> Configuration application
    - Cache -> Configured behavior

## TestCacheKeyGeneratorIntegration

Integration tests for CacheKeyGenerator with cache and monitoring.

Tests real component interactions in key generation workflows.

### test_key_generator_with_cache_and_monitoring_integration()

```python
async def test_key_generator_with_cache_and_monitoring_integration(self):
```

Test complete key generation workflow with cache and monitoring.

Verifies:
    Key generator integrates properly with cache operations and monitoring
    
Business Impact:
    Ensures key generation, caching, and monitoring work together correctly
    
Integration Points:
    - KeyGenerator -> Key generation with monitoring
    - Cache -> Key-based operations
    - Monitor -> Key generation metrics

## TestEndToEndCacheWorkflows

End-to-end integration tests for complete cache workflows.

Tests realistic usage patterns with multiple integrated components.

### test_complete_ai_cache_workflow_integration()

```python
async def test_complete_ai_cache_workflow_integration(self):
```

Test complete AI cache workflow with all components integrated.

Verifies:
    All AI cache components work together in realistic workflows
    
Business Impact:
    Ensures AI cache functionality works end-to-end in production scenarios
    
Integration Points:
    - Factory -> AI cache creation
    - KeyGenerator -> AI-specific key generation
    - Cache -> AI response storage and retrieval
    - Monitor -> AI cache performance tracking

### test_cache_fallback_behavior_integration()

```python
async def test_cache_fallback_behavior_integration(self):
```

Test cache fallback behavior integration across components.

Verifies:
    Graceful degradation works across all integrated components
    
Business Impact:
    Ensures system resilience when external dependencies are unavailable
    
Integration Points:
    - Factory -> Fallback cache creation
    - Settings -> Fallback configuration
    - Components -> Graceful degradation behavior

## TestCacheComponentInteroperability

Tests for cache component interoperability and compatibility.

Verifies different cache implementations can be used interchangeably.

### test_cache_interoperability_across_factory_methods()

```python
async def test_cache_interoperability_across_factory_methods(self, cache_type):
```

Test that caches created by different factory methods are interoperable.

Verifies:
    All factory-created caches support the same basic operations
    
Integration Points:
    - Factory methods -> Different cache creation paths
    - CacheInterface -> Consistent behavior across implementations
