# Test Security Integration and Validation

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/integration/test_cache_security.py`

This module provides integration tests for cache security features, validating that
the CacheFactory correctly applies security configurations and that security
validation works end-to-end with real Redis connections.

Focus on testing observable security behaviors through public interfaces rather than
internal security implementation details. Tests validate the contracts defined in
backend/contracts/infrastructure/cache/security.pyi for production confidence.

These tests use fakeredis for secure testing scenarios while validating real
security integration patterns that would work with production Redis instances.

## TestCacheSecurityIntegration

Test suite for verifying cache security integration and validation.

Integration Scope:
    Tests security configuration integration with CacheFactory, validating
    that security settings are properly applied and enforced during cache creation.

Business Impact:
    Ensures production Redis deployments are properly secured with authentication,
    TLS encryption, and proper security validation, protecting sensitive cached data.

Test Strategy:
    - Test SecurityConfig creation and validation with various configurations
    - Verify CacheFactory applies security settings correctly
    - Test security validation and error handling
    - Test authentication and connection security behavior
    - Validate security integration across different factory methods

    production deployment scenarios (AUTH, ACL, TLS).

Success Criteria:
    - SecurityConfig accepts AUTH password configuration
    - SecurityConfig accepts ACL username/password configuration
    - SecurityConfig accepts TLS configuration parameters
    - SecurityConfig validates configuration parameters

### test_security_manager_creation_and_basic_functionality()

```python
async def test_security_manager_creation_and_basic_functionality(self):
```

Test RedisCacheSecurityManager creation and basic functionality.

Behavior Under Test:
    RedisCacheSecurityManager should initialize properly with SecurityConfig
    and provide security management functionality.

    Ensures security manager can be created and used for managing
    Redis connection security in production environments.

Success Criteria:
    - Security manager initializes with valid SecurityConfig
    - Security manager provides security recommendations
    - Security manager provides security status information

### test_cache_factory_with_security_config_integration()

```python
async def test_cache_factory_with_security_config_integration(self, cache_factory):
```

Test CacheFactory integration with SecurityConfig for different cache types.

Behavior Under Test:
    CacheFactory should properly integrate SecurityConfig into cache creation
    for web, AI, and testing cache types, applying security settings appropriately.

Business Impact:
    Ensures all cache types can be secured consistently through the factory,
    providing unified security management across different application scenarios.

Success Criteria:
    - Web cache factory accepts SecurityConfig
    - AI cache factory accepts SecurityConfig  
    - Testing cache factory accepts SecurityConfig
    - SecurityConfig is properly integrated into cache instances

### test_security_validation_with_mock_redis_success()

```python
async def test_security_validation_with_mock_redis_success(self, cache_factory):
```

Test security validation with successful authentication scenario.

Behavior Under Test:
    When Redis authentication is properly configured and Redis accepts
    the credentials, security validation should report successful authentication.

Business Impact:
    Ensures production deployments can validate that security configuration
    is working correctly with the actual Redis instance.

Success Criteria:
    - Security manager can connect to authenticated Redis
    - Security validation reports successful authentication
    - Cache operations work with authenticated connection

### test_security_configuration_error_handling()

```python
async def test_security_configuration_error_handling(self, cache_factory):
```

Test security configuration validation and error handling.

Behavior Under Test:
    Invalid security configurations should be detected and appropriate
    errors should be raised during cache creation or security validation.

Business Impact:
    Ensures misconfigured security settings are caught early rather than
    causing runtime security vulnerabilities or connection failures.

Success Criteria:
    - Invalid TLS certificate paths are detected
    - Invalid configuration combinations are rejected
    - Appropriate error messages are provided for debugging

### test_cache_factory_security_fallback_behavior()

```python
async def test_cache_factory_security_fallback_behavior(self, cache_factory):
```

Test cache factory behavior when security configuration causes connection failures.

Behavior Under Test:
    When security configuration prevents Redis connection (wrong password,
    TLS issues, etc.), factory should handle the failure appropriately based
    on fail_on_connection_error setting.

Business Impact:
    Ensures applications can start with degraded functionality when Redis
    security is misconfigured, while still enforcing security in strict mode.

Success Criteria:
    - fail_on_connection_error=False allows fallback to InMemoryCache
    - fail_on_connection_error=True raises InfrastructureError
    - Fallback behavior provides working cache functionality
    - Security errors are properly logged and reported

### test_security_config_environment_integration()

```python
async def test_security_config_environment_integration(self, monkeypatch):
```

Test SecurityConfig creation from environment variables.

Behavior Under Test:
    SecurityConfig should be creatable from environment variables
    for containerized deployment scenarios.

Business Impact:
    Ensures Redis security can be configured through environment
    variables in Docker, Kubernetes, and other containerized deployments.

Success Criteria:
    - Environment variables are properly mapped to SecurityConfig
    - Missing environment variables result in None or defaults
    - Invalid environment values are handled appropriately

### test_security_validation_comprehensive_reporting()

```python
async def test_security_validation_comprehensive_reporting(self):
```

Test comprehensive security validation reporting.

Behavior Under Test:
    Security validation should provide detailed reporting about
    security status, vulnerabilities, and recommendations.
