## TestCacheMonitoringWorkflow

End-to-end test for the cache monitoring and observability workflow.

Scope:
    Verifies that actions performed via the cache management API are
    correctly reflected in the monitoring and metrics endpoints.
    
Business Critical:
    Monitoring and metrics are essential for operational visibility,
    capacity planning, and incident response in production environments.
    
Test Strategy:
    - End-to-end workflow testing from operations to metrics
    - Error handling validation for monitoring endpoints
    - Performance and consistency testing under various load conditions
    - Complete metrics structure validation
    
External Dependencies:
    - Uses authenticated_client fixture for API access
    - Requires cleanup_test_cache fixture for test isolation
    - Assumes proper cache infrastructure configuration
    
Known Limitations:
    - Load testing is simulated and may not reflect production volumes
    - Timing-based tests may be sensitive to system performance
    - Does not test actual Redis/memory cache backends directly

### test_invalidation_action_updates_metrics()

```python
async def test_invalidation_action_updates_metrics(self, authenticated_client):
```

Test that an invalidation action is reflected in the metrics and stats endpoints.

Test Purpose:
    This test ensures the monitoring and metrics systems are correctly integrated
    with the cache's operational endpoints. It validates the end-to-end observability
    of the cache management service.

Business Impact:
    Accurate metrics are critical for operational health monitoring, capacity
    planning, and identifying optimization opportunities. This test provides
    confidence that our monitoring data is reliable.

Test Scenario:
    1.  GIVEN the cache service is running.
    2.  WHEN an administrator performs a cache invalidation.
    3.  THEN the invalidation statistics and performance metrics should
        be updated to reflect this specific action.

Success Criteria:
    - The `POST /internal/cache/invalidate` request succeeds with a 200 status code.
    - The response message confirms the correct invalidation pattern.
    - The `GET /internal/cache/invalidation-stats` endpoint shows updated frequency data.
    - The `GET /internal/cache/metrics` endpoint's total operations count increases.

### test_monitoring_endpoint_error_handling()

```python
async def test_monitoring_endpoint_error_handling(self, authenticated_client):
```

Test that monitoring endpoints handle errors gracefully.

Test Purpose:
    Validates that monitoring endpoints provide stable responses
    even when underlying cache systems experience issues.
    
Business Impact:
    Reliable monitoring during system stress is critical for
    operational visibility and incident response.
    
Test Scenario:
    GIVEN potential error conditions in the cache system
    WHEN monitoring endpoints are accessed during these conditions
    THEN endpoints respond gracefully with appropriate error information
    
Success Criteria:
    - Monitoring endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes
    - Error responses include helpful diagnostic information
    - System remains stable during monitoring under stress

### test_metrics_consistency_across_operations()

```python
async def test_metrics_consistency_across_operations(self, authenticated_client):
```

Test that metrics remain consistent across multiple cache operations.

Test Purpose:
    Validates that metrics tracking is accurate and consistent
    across multiple invalidation operations performed in sequence.
    
Business Impact:
    Accurate metrics are essential for capacity planning, performance
    monitoring, and operational decision-making.
    
Test Scenario:
    GIVEN multiple sequential cache invalidation operations
    WHEN metrics are retrieved after each operation
    THEN metrics should show consistent incremental changes
    
Success Criteria:
    - Each operation increments total operations counter by exactly 1
    - Pattern tracking accurately reflects all operations
    - No metrics are lost or double-counted during rapid operations

### test_monitoring_performance_under_load()

```python
async def test_monitoring_performance_under_load(self, authenticated_client):
```

Test monitoring endpoint performance under simulated load.

Test Purpose:
    Validates that monitoring endpoints remain responsive
    and provide timely responses even during high operation volumes.
    
Business Impact:
    Monitoring must remain accessible during peak loads to enable
    real-time operational visibility and incident response.
    
Test Scenario:
    GIVEN multiple rapid invalidation operations
    WHEN monitoring endpoints are accessed during this load
    THEN responses are received within acceptable time limits
    
Success Criteria:
    - Monitoring endpoints respond within 5 seconds under load
    - Response data remains accurate during high operation volume
    - No timeout or connection errors occur during load testing

### test_monitoring_metrics_precise_increments()

```python
async def test_monitoring_metrics_precise_increments(self, authenticated_client):
```

Test that monitoring metrics accurately reflect specific cache operations with exact increments.

Test Purpose:
    Validates that monitoring metrics provide precise, accurate tracking of cache operations
    rather than approximations. Critical for operational confidence and capacity planning.
    
Business Impact:
    Accurate monitoring data enables reliable capacity planning, performance optimization,
    and operational alerting. Imprecise metrics lead to incorrect operational decisions.
    Precise metrics provide foundation for SLA monitoring and performance baselines.
    
Test Scenario:
    1. Capture baseline metrics from monitoring endpoint
    2. Execute controlled, countable cache operations via text processing API
    3. Verify that performance metrics show exact expected increments
    4. Validate cache hit/miss ratios reflect actual operation outcomes
    
Success Criteria:
    - Total cache operations increment by exact number of performed operations
    - Cache hits and misses accurately reflect cache behavior patterns  
    - Performance metrics provide precise operational data
    - Monitoring endpoint responds reliably with structured data
