# Unit tests for AIResponseCache error handling and resilience behavior.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/redis_ai/test_redis_ai_error_handling.py`

This test suite verifies the observable error handling behaviors documented in the
AIResponseCache public contract. Tests focus on behavior-driven testing principles
described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

Coverage Focus:
    - Error handling and graceful degradation patterns
    - Parameter validation with detailed error context  
    - Infrastructure failure resilience
    - Performance monitoring integration during errors

Implementation Notes:
    - Tests focus on observable behavior rather than implementation details
    - Infrastructure tests verify actual error conditions rather than mocking internal components
    - Parameter validation tests are based on observed behavior of the key generation system
    - Some integration-level tests are skipped in favor of proper integration test coverage

Error Handling Philosophy:
    - Infrastructure errors should provide meaningful context for debugging
    - Parameter validation should give clear feedback for fixing issues
    - Performance monitoring should continue during error conditions
    - Cache operations should degrade gracefully without breaking domain services

External Dependencies:
    All external dependencies are real components where possible, following
    the behavior-driven testing approach of testing actual observable outcomes.

## TestAIResponseCacheErrorHandling

Test suite for AIResponseCache error handling with standard cache interface.

Scope:
    - InfrastructureError handling for Redis failures with standard interface

    - Error context preservation and logging
    
Business Critical:
    Robust error handling ensures AI services continue operating during failures
    
Test Strategy:
    - Unit tests for build_key validation error handling
    - Integration tests for graceful degradation with standard cache operations
    - Error propagation tests from dependencies to AI cache
    - Recovery behavior validation for transient failures
    
External Dependencies:
    - None

    Key generation doesn't depend on Redis connectivity and remains functional
    
Business Impact:
    Domain services can generate cache keys even during Redis outages
    
Scenario:
    Given: AI cache with Redis connectivity issues
