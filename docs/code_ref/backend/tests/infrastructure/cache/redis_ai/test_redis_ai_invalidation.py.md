# Unit tests for AIResponseCache refactored implementation.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/redis_ai/test_redis_ai_invalidation.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
AIResponseCache public contract (redis_ai.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- Infrastructure service (>90% test coverage requirement)
- Behavior verification per docstring specifications
- Error handling and graceful degradation patterns
- Performance monitoring integration

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
