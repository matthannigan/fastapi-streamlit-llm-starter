# Unit tests for AIResponseCache refactored implementation.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/redis_ai/test_redis_ai_connection.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
AIResponseCache public contract (redis_ai.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/testing/TESTING.md.

Coverage Focus:
    - Infrastructure service (>90% test coverage requirement)
    - Behavior verification per docstring specifications
    - Error handling and graceful degradation patterns
    - Performance monitoring integration

External Dependencies:
    All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
    the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.

## TestAIResponseCacheConnection

Test suite for AIResponseCache connection management and Redis integration.

Scope:
    - connect() method delegation to parent class
    - Connection success and failure scenarios
    - Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable
    - Connection state management through inheritance
    - Integration with performance monitoring during connection events
    
Business Critical:
    Connection management affects cache availability and AI service performance
    
Test Strategy:
    - Unit tests for connection method delegation to parent class
    - Integration tests for connection success and failure scenarios
    - Graceful degradation tests for Redis unavailability
    - Performance monitoring integration during connection events
    
External Dependencies:
    - None

### test_connect_delegates_to_parent_and_returns_connection_status()

```python
def test_connect_delegates_to_parent_and_returns_connection_status(self):
```

Test that connect method delegates to parent class and returns proper status.

Verifies:
    Connection management follows proper inheritance delegation pattern
    
Business Impact:
    Ensures reliable connection establishment for cache operations
    
Scenario:
    Given: AIResponseCache instance ready for Redis connection
    When: connect method is called
    Then: GenericRedisCache.connect is called through inheritance
    And: Connection success status (True) is returned from parent
    And: Connection establishment is handled entirely by parent class
    And: AI cache doesn't duplicate connection logic
    
Connection Delegation Verified:
    - Parent class connect method is invoked
    - Connection result (True for success) is returned
    - Parent class manages Redis connection state
    - AI cache inherits connection behavior without duplication
    
Fixtures Used:
    - None
    
Inheritance Pattern:
    Connection management demonstrates proper inheritance delegation

### test_connect_handles_redis_failure_gracefully()

```python
def test_connect_handles_redis_failure_gracefully(self):
```

Test that connect method handles Redis connection failures gracefully.

Verifies:
    Connection failures don't break AI cache initialization
    
Business Impact:
    Allows AI services to operate in memory-only mode during Redis outages
    
Scenario:
    Given: Redis server unavailable or connection configured incorrectly
    When: connect method is called
    Then: GenericRedisCache.connect returns False indicating failure
    And: AI cache accepts connection failure gracefully
    And: Cache operates in memory-only mode with degraded functionality
    And: Connection failure is handled without raising exceptions
    
Graceful Connection Failure Handling:
    - Connection failure (False return) handled without exceptions
    - Cache continues operating in memory-only mode
    - Performance monitor may record connection failure event
    - AI services can still use cache with reduced functionality
    
Fixtures Used:
    - None
    
Degraded Mode Operation:
    Cache continues functioning with memory-only operations

    - test_cache_operations_work_without_redis_connection()

### test_connect_integrates_with_performance_monitoring()

```python
async def test_connect_integrates_with_performance_monitoring(self, real_performance_monitor):
```

Test that connect method integrates with performance monitoring system.

Verifies:
    Connection events are tracked for performance analysis
    
Business Impact:
    Enables monitoring of connection patterns and reliability
    
Scenario:
    Given: AIResponseCache with performance monitoring enabled
    When: connect method is called
    Then: Performance monitor may record connection attempt timing
    And: Connection success/failure status is tracked for reliability analysis
    And: Connection performance contributes to overall system monitoring
    
Performance Monitoring Integration:
    - Connection timing may be measured and recorded
    - Connection success/failure rates tracked for reliability metrics
    - Connection performance contributes to cache health monitoring
    - Performance data helps with capacity planning and troubleshooting
    
Fixtures Used:
    - real_performance_monitor: Real performance monitor instance
    
Connection Performance Analytics:
    Connection events contribute to comprehensive performance monitoring

    - test_performance_monitoring_continues_during_errors()

### test_standard_cache_operations_work_without_redis_connection()

```python
def test_standard_cache_operations_work_without_redis_connection(self, sample_text, sample_ai_response):
```

Test that standard cache operations continue working without Redis connection.

Verifies:
    Memory-only operations provide graceful degradation when Redis unavailable
    
Business Impact:
    AI services maintain some caching capability during Redis outages
    
Scenario:
    Given: AIResponseCache operating without Redis connection (connection failed)
    When: Standard cache operations (build_key, get, set) are called
    Then: Operations use memory-only caching through parent class
    And: build_key continues generating consistent cache keys
    And: get/set operations use memory-only caching through GenericRedisCache
    And: Performance monitoring tracks memory-only operation patterns
    
Memory-Only Operation Verified:
    - build_key generates keys regardless of Redis connection status
    - set() stores data in memory cache only through parent class
    - get() retrieves from memory cache only through parent class
    - Operations complete successfully without Redis
    - Performance monitoring tracks degraded mode operations
    
Fixtures Used:
    - sample_text, sample_ai_response: Test data for operations
    
Graceful Degradation Pattern:
    Cache provides reduced functionality rather than complete failure
