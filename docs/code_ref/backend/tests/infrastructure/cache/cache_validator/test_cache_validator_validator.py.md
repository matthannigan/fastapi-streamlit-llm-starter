# Unit tests for CacheValidator validation functionality.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/cache_validator/test_cache_validator_validator.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
CacheValidator class public contract (cache_validator.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- Infrastructure service (>90% test coverage requirement)
- Configuration validation with JSON schema support
- Template generation and management
- Configuration comparison and recommendation

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
