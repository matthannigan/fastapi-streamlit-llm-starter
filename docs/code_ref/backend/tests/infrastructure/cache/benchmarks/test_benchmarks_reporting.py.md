# Test suite for cache benchmark reporting with multi-format output and detailed analysis.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/benchmarks/test_benchmarks_reporting.py`

This module tests the sophisticated report generation infrastructure supporting multiple
output formats including human-readable text, structured JSON, GitHub-compatible markdown,
and CI/CD optimized reports with performance badges and automated insights.

## Classes Under Test

- BenchmarkReporter: Abstract base class with analysis utilities
- TextReporter: Human-readable console/log reports with configurable verbosity
- CIReporter: CI/CD pipeline optimized reports with badges and concise insights
- JSONReporter: Structured JSON output for API integration and programmatic processing
- MarkdownReporter: GitHub-flavored markdown with collapsible sections
- ReporterFactory: Factory pattern for creating reporters with auto-detection

## Test Strategy

- Unit tests for individual reporter classes and their formatting capabilities
- Integration tests for factory pattern and format auto-detection
- Content validation for each output format with comprehensive coverage
- Analysis algorithm testing with controlled benchmark data
- Configuration testing for verbosity levels and customization options

## External Dependencies

- Uses sample BenchmarkSuite objects for report generation testing
- Uses mock environment variables for format auto-detection testing
- No fixtures required from conftest.py (reporter testing is self-contained)

## Test Data Requirements

- Sample BenchmarkSuite data with various performance characteristics
- Sample CachePerformanceThresholds for analysis testing
- Environment variable scenarios for auto-detection validation
