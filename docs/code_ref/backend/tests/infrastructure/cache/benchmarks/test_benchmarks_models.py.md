# Test suite for cache benchmarks data models with statistical analysis and comparison utilities.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/benchmarks/test_benchmarks_models.py`

This module tests the comprehensive data model infrastructure for cache performance benchmarking
including individual result containers, before/after comparison analysis, and benchmark
suite aggregation with performance grading and statistical analysis capabilities.

## Classes Under Test

- BenchmarkResult: Individual benchmark measurement with comprehensive metrics and analysis
- ComparisonResult: Before/after performance comparison with regression detection
- BenchmarkSuite: Collection of benchmark results with suite-level analysis and grading

## Test Strategy

- Unit tests for individual data model validation and method behavior
- Integration tests for data model interactions and serialization capabilities
- Statistical calculation verification with controlled test data
- Performance grading algorithm validation with known threshold boundaries
- Serialization testing for JSON export and data persistence capabilities

## External Dependencies

- No external dependencies (models use only standard library modules)
- No fixtures required from conftest.py (self-contained data structures)
- All test data is created directly in test methods for complete control

## Test Data Requirements

- Sample benchmark result data with various performance characteristics
- Sample comparison scenarios with different change percentages
- Sample benchmark suite data with multiple results and configurations
