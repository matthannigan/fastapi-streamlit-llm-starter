# Test suite for cache benchmark data generator with realistic workload simulation.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/benchmarks/test_benchmarks_generator.py`

This module tests the sophisticated test data generation infrastructure providing
realistic workload patterns that simulate production cache usage scenarios with
varied datasets across multiple dimensions including size, complexity, content types,
and access patterns for comprehensive cache performance evaluation.

## Class Under Test

- CacheBenchmarkDataGenerator: Advanced data generator with realistic workload simulation

## Test Strategy

- Unit tests for individual data generation methods with size and content validation
- Integration tests for complete dataset generation workflows
- Content diversity verification across different data types and patterns
- Performance characteristic testing for compression and memory scenarios
- Data realism validation against production-like patterns and structures

## External Dependencies

- No external dependencies (generator uses only standard library modules)
- No fixtures required from conftest.py (self-contained data generation)
- All test data is generated internally for complete test isolation

## Test Data Requirements

- Generated data sets for validation against expected patterns
- Size distribution analysis for memory pressure testing
- Content analysis for compression characteristics verification
- Pattern analysis for concurrent access simulation validation
