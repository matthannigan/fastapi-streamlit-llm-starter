# Test suite for cache benchmarks core orchestration module.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/benchmarks/test_benchmarks_core.py`

This module tests the comprehensive benchmarking orchestration classes including
regression detection, statistical analysis, comprehensive reporting, and before/after
comparison analysis with modular architecture and advanced analytics capabilities.

## Classes Under Test

- PerformanceRegressionDetector: Automated performance regression detection and analysis
- CachePerformanceBenchmark: Main benchmarking orchestration with comprehensive analytics

## Test Strategy

- Unit tests for regression detection algorithms with configurable thresholds
- Integration tests for complete benchmark orchestration workflows
- Performance measurement validation against known baselines
- Statistical analysis verification with controlled test data
- Error handling tests for cache operation failures and timeouts
- Memory tracking validation throughout benchmark execution lifecycle

## External Dependencies

- Uses mock_cache_interface fixture for cache operation testing
- Uses mock_performance_monitor fixture for metrics collection testing
- Uses mock_configuration_error fixture for error scenario testing
- Internal dependencies (models, utils, generator) are tested directly

## Test Data Requirements

- Benchmark result samples for regression analysis
- Performance baseline data for comparison testing
- Cache operation data for statistical validation
- Memory usage data for tracking verification
