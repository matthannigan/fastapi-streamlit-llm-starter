# Test suite for cache benchmarks statistical analysis and memory tracking utilities.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/benchmarks/test_benchmarks_utils.py`

This module tests the advanced statistical calculation and memory monitoring infrastructure
providing comprehensive statistical analysis with outlier detection, confidence intervals,
and cross-platform memory tracking with fallback mechanisms for robust benchmark execution.

## Classes Under Test

- StatisticalCalculator: Advanced statistical analysis with outlier detection and confidence intervals
- MemoryTracker: Cross-platform memory monitoring with fallback mechanisms

## Test Strategy

- Unit tests for individual statistical calculation methods with edge cases
- Integration tests for complete statistical analysis workflows
- Cross-platform memory tracking testing with fallback validation
- Error handling tests for edge cases and missing dependencies
- Statistical accuracy verification with known datasets

## External Dependencies

- No external dependencies (utils uses only standard library modules)
- No fixtures required from conftest.py (self-contained utility testing)
- Memory tracking tests may mock psutil availability for fallback testing

## Test Data Requirements

- Statistical test datasets with known expected results
- Edge case datasets (empty, single value, outliers)
- Memory measurement scenarios for tracking validation
