# Unit tests for AIResponseCacheConfig configuration management.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/ai_config/test_ai_config.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
AIResponseCacheConfig public contract (ai_config.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- Infrastructure service (>90% test coverage requirement)
- Configuration validation and factory methods
- Parameter mapping and conversion behavior
- Environment integration and preset loading

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
