# Unit tests for CachePerformanceMonitor statistics and analysis functionality.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/monitoring/test_statistics_and_analysis.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
CachePerformanceMonitor statistics methods (monitoring.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- Statistics calculation accuracy and performance analysis
- Threshold-based alerting and recommendation systems
- Data export and metrics aggregation functionality
- Memory usage analysis and trend detection

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
