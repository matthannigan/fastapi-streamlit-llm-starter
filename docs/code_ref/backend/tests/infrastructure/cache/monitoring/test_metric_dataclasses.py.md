# Unit tests for performance monitoring metric dataclasses.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/monitoring/test_metric_dataclasses.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
monitoring metric dataclasses (monitoring.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- Dataclass initialization and post-initialization validation
- Data structure integrity and field validation
- Type safety and value constraint enforcement
- Performance metric data representation accuracy

## External Dependencies

No external dependencies - testing pure dataclass functionality and validation.
