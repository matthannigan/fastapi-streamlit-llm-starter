# Unit tests for CachePerformanceMonitor main functionality.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/monitoring/test_performance_monitor.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
CachePerformanceMonitor public contract (monitoring.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- Infrastructure service (>90% test coverage requirement)
- Behavior verification per docstring specifications
- Performance monitoring and analytics functionality
- Data retention and cleanup mechanisms

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
