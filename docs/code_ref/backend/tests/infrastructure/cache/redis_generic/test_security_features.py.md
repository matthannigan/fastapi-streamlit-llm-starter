# Comprehensive test suite for GenericRedisCache security features.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/redis_generic/test_security_features.py`

This module provides systematic behavioral testing of the security functionality
including security validation, configuration management, reporting, and testing
capabilities integrated with the GenericRedisCache.

## Test Coverage

- Security configuration validation and management
- Security status reporting and recommendations
- Comprehensive security assessment and reporting
- Security configuration testing and validation
- Integration with Redis connection security
- Error handling for security-related operations

## Testing Philosophy

- Uses behavior-driven testing with Given/When/Then structure
- Tests security functionality with realistic mock configurations
- Validates security integration without compromising test security
- Ensures graceful degradation when security features are unavailable
- Comprehensive coverage of security scenarios and edge cases

## Test Organization

- TestSecurityValidation: Security validation and assessment functionality
- TestSecurityStatusManagement: Security status reporting and management
- TestSecurityReporting: Security report generation and formatting
- TestSecurityConfigurationTesting: Security configuration testing and validation
