# Comprehensive test suite for GenericRedisCache security features.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/redis_generic/test_security_features.py`

This module provides systematic behavioral testing of the security functionality
including security validation, configuration management, reporting, and testing
capabilities integrated with the GenericRedisCache.

Test Coverage:
    - Security configuration validation and management
    - Security status reporting and recommendations
    - Comprehensive security assessment and reporting
    - Security configuration testing and validation
    - Integration with Redis connection security
    - Error handling for security-related operations

Testing Philosophy:
    - Uses behavior-driven testing with Given/When/Then structure
    - Tests security functionality with realistic mock configurations
    - Validates security integration without compromising test security
    - Ensures graceful degradation when security features are unavailable
    - Comprehensive coverage of security scenarios and edge cases

Test Organization:
    - TestSecurityValidation: Security validation and assessment functionality
    - TestSecurityStatusManagement: Security status reporting and management
    - TestSecurityReporting: Security report generation and formatting
    - TestSecurityConfigurationTesting: Security configuration testing and validation
