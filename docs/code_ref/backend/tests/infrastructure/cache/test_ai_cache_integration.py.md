# Comprehensive Integration Testing Framework for AI Cache System

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/test_ai_cache_integration.py`

This module provides end-to-end integration tests for the AI cache system,
validating the complete interaction between AIResponseCache, configuration management,
parameter mapping, and monitoring systems. Tests ensure the cache system works
correctly as an integrated whole with proper inheritance patterns.

## Test Coverage

- End-to-end cache workflows with various text sizes and operations
- Inheritance method delegation from GenericRedisCache
- AI-specific invalidation patterns and behavior
- Memory cache promotion logic and LRU behavior
- Configuration integration and validation
- Monitoring integration and metrics collection
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Performance benchmarks and security validation

## Architecture

- Uses async/await patterns consistently
- Handles Redis unavailability gracefully with memory cache fallback
- Tests both positive and negative scenarios
- Provides comprehensive error reporting
- Follows pytest async testing patterns

## Dependencies

- pytest-asyncio for async test execution
- AIResponseCache and supporting infrastructure
- Configuration management systems
- Performance monitoring framework
