# Unit tests for CacheStrategy enum behavior.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/cache_presets/test_cache_presets_strategy.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
CacheStrategy enum public contract (cache_presets.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- Infrastructure service (>90% test coverage requirement)
- Enum value handling and serialization behavior
- String enum functionality and comparison operations
- Strategy-based configuration mapping

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
