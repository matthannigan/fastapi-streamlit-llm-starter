# Unit tests for CacheConfig dataclass behavior.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/cache_presets/test_cache_presets_config.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
CacheConfig dataclass public contract (cache_presets.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- Infrastructure service (>90% test coverage requirement)
- Configuration dataclass behavior and validation
- Strategy-based parameter initialization
- Configuration conversion and serialization

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
