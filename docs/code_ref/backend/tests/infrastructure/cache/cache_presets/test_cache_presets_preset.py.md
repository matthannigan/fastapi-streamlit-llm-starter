# Unit tests for CachePreset dataclass behavior.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/cache_presets/test_cache_presets_preset.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
CachePreset dataclass public contract (cache_presets.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- Infrastructure service (>90% test coverage requirement)
- Preset configuration management and validation
- Preset-to-config conversion functionality
- Environment-specific preset optimization

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
