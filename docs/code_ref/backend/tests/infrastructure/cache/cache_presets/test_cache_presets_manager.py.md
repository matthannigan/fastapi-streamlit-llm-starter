# Unit tests for CachePresetManager behavior.

  file_path: `backend/tests/infrastructure/cache/cache_presets/test_cache_presets_manager.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
CachePresetManager class public contract (cache_presets.pyi). Tests focus on the
behavior-driven testing principles described in docs/guides/developer/TESTING.md.

## Coverage Focus

- Infrastructure service (>90% test coverage requirement)
- Preset management and recommendation functionality
- Environment detection and intelligent preset selection
- Validation integration and preset quality assurance

## External Dependencies

All external dependencies are mocked using fixtures from conftest.py following
the documented public contracts to ensure accurate behavior simulation.
