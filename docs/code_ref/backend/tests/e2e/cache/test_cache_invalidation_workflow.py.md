## TestCacheInvalidationWorkflow

End-to-end test for the cache invalidation operational workflow.

Scope:
    Validates the core functionality and security of the cache invalidation API endpoint.
    
Business Critical:
    Cache invalidation is a destructive operation that directly impacts system
    performance and data consistency. Security and reliability are paramount.
    
Test Strategy:
    - Comprehensive authentication and authorization testing
    - Input validation and error handling verification
    - Edge case pattern handling validation
    - Security boundary testing for unauthorized access prevention
    
External Dependencies:
    - Uses client fixture for unauthenticated requests
    - Uses authenticated_client fixture for authorized operations
    - Requires cleanup_test_cache fixture for test isolation
    
Known Limitations:
    - Does not test actual cache invalidation effects on stored data
    - Pattern matching behavior depends on cache implementation details
    - Load testing scenarios are simulated rather than production-scale

### test_invalidation_requires_authentication()

```python
async def test_invalidation_requires_authentication(self, client):
```

Test that the invalidation endpoint is protected and requires a valid API key.

Test Purpose:
    To verify the security contract of a destructive operation. Unauthorized
    cache invalidation could lead to severe performance degradation.

Business Impact:
    Ensures that only authorized operators can perform actions that impact
    application performance and cost, preventing accidental or malicious interference.

Test Scenario:
    1.  GIVEN the cache service is running.
    2.  WHEN a `POST` request is made to `/internal/cache/invalidate` WITHOUT an API key.
    3.  THEN the request should be rejected with a `401 Unauthorized` status code.
    4.  WHEN the request is made WITH a valid API key.
    5.  THEN the request should succeed with a `200 OK` status code.

Success Criteria:
    - Request without API key returns status 401.
    - Request with a valid API key returns status 200.
    - The successful response payload matches the documented format.

### test_invalidation_authentication_scenarios()

```python
async def test_invalidation_authentication_scenarios(self, client, scenario, headers, expected_status):
```

Test comprehensive authentication scenarios for cache invalidation endpoint.

Test Purpose:
    Validates that the invalidation endpoint properly handles various
    authentication failure scenarios with appropriate error responses.
    
Business Impact:
    Comprehensive security validation prevents unauthorized cache operations
    that could impact system performance and data consistency.
    
Test Scenario:
    GIVEN various authentication scenarios (missing, empty, invalid, wrong keys)
    WHEN invalidation requests are made with these authentication states
    THEN appropriate error responses are returned without exposing system details
    
Success Criteria:
    - All invalid authentication scenarios return 401 Unauthorized
    - Error responses don't leak sensitive information
    - System remains stable under various authentication attacks

### test_invalidation_malformed_requests()

```python
async def test_invalidation_malformed_requests(self, authenticated_client):
```

Test invalidation endpoint handles malformed requests gracefully.

Test Purpose:
    Validates that the API properly validates request parameters
    and provides clear error messages for malformed requests.
    
Business Impact:
    Proper input validation prevents system errors and provides
    clear feedback to API consumers for debugging.
    
Test Scenario:
    GIVEN various malformed invalidation requests
    WHEN these requests are sent to the invalidation endpoint
    THEN appropriate validation errors are returned with helpful messages
    
Success Criteria:
    - Missing pattern parameter uses default empty string per API contract
    - Empty pattern parameter is valid (matches all entries)
    - Authentication is working for the test to be meaningful

### test_invalidation_edge_case_patterns()

```python
async def test_invalidation_edge_case_patterns(self, authenticated_client):
```

Test cache invalidation with various edge case patterns.

Test Purpose:
    Validates that the cache invalidation system properly handles
    edge cases in pattern matching without system failures.
    
Business Impact:
    Robust pattern handling prevents system crashes and ensures
    reliable cache management under various operational scenarios.
    
Test Scenario:
    GIVEN various edge case invalidation patterns
    WHEN invalidation requests are made with these patterns  
    THEN system handles them gracefully without errors
    
Success Criteria:
    - Authentication is working for meaningful test results
    - Special characters in patterns are handled correctly
    - Wildcard patterns work as expected
    - Very specific patterns are processed successfully

### test_invalidation_actually_removes_cache_entries()

```python
async def test_invalidation_actually_removes_cache_entries(self, authenticated_client):
```

Test that cache invalidation operations actually remove entries from cache storage.

Test Purpose:
    Validates that invalidation doesn't just return success messages but actually
    affects cache state by removing targeted entries while preserving others.
    
Business Impact:
    Critical for cache consistency and data freshness. Ensures invalidation
    operations provide real behavioral outcomes, not false positives.
    Prevents stale data from persisting after invalidation commands.
    
Test Scenario:
    1. Populate cache with multiple entries using production text processing API
    2. Verify entries exist by retrieving them through subsequent API calls
    3. Execute targeted invalidation with specific pattern matching subset
    4. Verify behavioral outcome: targeted entries gone, unmatched entries remain
    
Success Criteria:
    - Cache population succeeds and entries are retrievable
    - Invalidation with pattern removes only matching entries
    - Non-matching entries continue to exist after pattern invalidation
    - System maintains cache consistency throughout the workflow
