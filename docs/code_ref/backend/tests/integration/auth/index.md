# Authentication Integration Tests

Integration tests for the environment-aware authentication security system following our **small, dense suite with maximum confidence** philosophy.

## Test Organization

### Critical Integration Seams (3 Tests Total)

1. **`test_environment_aware_auth_flow.py`** (CRITICAL)
    - Complete HTTP authentication flow from request to response
    - Environment detection → Security policy → Authentication validation
    - Tests production security enforcement and development mode

2. **`test_multi_key_endpoint_integration.py`** (HIGH)
    - Multiple API key management with real protected endpoints
    - Primary + additional key validation and equivalence testing
    - Real endpoint protection validation

3. **`test_auth_status_integration.py`** (MEDIUM)
    - `/v1/auth/status` endpoint as comprehensive integration demonstration
    - Complete authentication system integration in single testable endpoint
    - Environment-aware response formatting and error handling

## Testing Philosophy Applied

- **Outside-In Testing**: All tests start from HTTP boundaries (FastAPI TestClient)
- **High-Fidelity Infrastructure**: Real environment variables, actual FastAPI dependencies
- **Behavior Focus**: Observable HTTP responses and outcomes, not internal state
- **No Internal Mocking**: Tests real component collaboration

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all authentication integration tests
make test-backend PYTEST_ARGS="tests/integration/auth/ -v"

# Run specific test file
make test-backend PYTEST_ARGS="tests/integration/auth/test_environment_aware_auth_flow.py -v"

# Run with coverage
make test-backend PYTEST_ARGS="tests/integration/auth/ --cov=app.infrastructure.security.auth"
```

## Test Fixtures

- Environment Configuration: Production, development, multi-key environments
- Authentication Headers: Valid, invalid, secondary key headers
- FastAPI Test Client: Real HTTP client with complete middleware stack

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Complete authentication flows work from HTTP request to response
- ✅ Environment detection properly influences security enforcement
- ✅ Multiple API keys provide equivalent access to protected resources
- ✅ HTTP exception conversion provides proper 401 responses with context
- ✅ Authentication works consistently across different environments

## What's NOT Tested (Unit Test Concerns)

- Thread safety and concurrent request handling
- O(1) performance characteristics and memory optimization
- Feature detection and configuration inheritance
- Programmatic authentication without HTTP context
- Internal authentication state management
