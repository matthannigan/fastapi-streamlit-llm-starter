# Integration tests for authentication status API endpoint integration.

  file_path: `backend/tests/integration/auth/test_auth_status_integration.py`

Tests the /v1/auth/status endpoint as a comprehensive demonstration of
authentication system integration with environment context and response formatting.

Seam Under Test:
    /v1/auth/status → verify_api_key_http → Authentication System → Environment Context → Response

Critical Paths:
    - Status endpoint demonstrates complete authentication integration
    - Error responses show proper HTTP exception handling integration
    - Response format varies appropriately based on environment context

## TestAuthStatusIntegration

Integration tests for authentication status API endpoint.

Seam Under Test:
    HTTP Request → /v1/auth/status Endpoint → Authentication Dependencies → Response Generation
    
Critical Paths:
    - Status endpoint serves as comprehensive authentication system demonstration
    - Response format and content varies appropriately by environment and auth state
    - Error handling demonstrates proper HTTP exception conversion and context preservation

### test_auth_status_endpoint_demonstrates_complete_integration_success()

```python
def test_auth_status_endpoint_demonstrates_complete_integration_success(self, client, production_environment):
```

Test /v1/auth/status demonstrates complete authentication integration.

Integration Scope:
    Tests entire authentication stack through single endpoint including
    dependency injection, authentication validation, environment detection,
    and structured response generation.
    
Business Impact:
    Provides comprehensive authentication validation endpoint for
    monitoring, debugging, and API client verification.
    
Test Strategy:
    - Configure production environment with valid API key
    - Call status endpoint with valid authentication
    - Verify complete response includes all integration components
    
Success Criteria:
    - Returns 200 with complete authentication status information
    - Response includes truncated API key prefix for verification
    - Environment context properly integrated into response
    - Authentication metadata demonstrates system integration

### test_auth_status_error_responses_demonstrate_http_exception_integration()

```python
def test_auth_status_error_responses_demonstrate_http_exception_integration(self, client, production_environment):
```

Test /v1/auth/status error handling demonstrates HTTP exception integration.

Integration Scope:
    Tests authentication failure handling through custom exception
    generation, HTTP conversion, and structured error response formatting.
    
Business Impact:
    Ensures API clients receive consistent, actionable error responses
    with sufficient context for debugging authentication issues.
    
Test Strategy:
    - Attempt status check with invalid authentication
    - Verify proper 401 response with structured error format
    - Ensure error context preservation and HTTP compliance
    
Success Criteria:
    - Returns 401 Unauthorized with proper HTTP headers
    - Error response includes structured detail and context
    - WWW-Authenticate header present for HTTP compliance
    - Error context includes debugging information without exposing secrets

### test_auth_status_missing_credentials_shows_proper_authentication_challenge()

```python
def test_auth_status_missing_credentials_shows_proper_authentication_challenge(self, client, production_environment):
```

Test /v1/auth/status returns proper authentication challenge for missing credentials.

Integration Scope:
    Tests missing credentials handling through dependency injection,
    security policy enforcement, and HTTP challenge response generation.
    
Business Impact:
    Ensures unauthenticated requests receive proper HTTP authentication
    challenge with clear guidance for required authentication.
    
Test Strategy:
    - Make status request without authentication headers
    - Verify proper 401 challenge response with WWW-Authenticate header
    - Ensure error message clearly indicates authentication requirement
    
Success Criteria:
    - Returns 401 with WWW-Authenticate challenge header
    - Error message clearly indicates authentication requirement
    - Response context indicates missing credentials (not invalid)
    - HTTP response complies with authentication challenge standards

### test_auth_status_environment_context_integration_production_vs_development()

```python
def test_auth_status_environment_context_integration_production_vs_development(self, client, development_environment):
```

Test status endpoint responses vary correctly between environments.

Integration Scope:
    Tests environment detection integration with response formatting,
    ensuring status responses appropriately reflect deployment context.
    
Business Impact:
    Provides environment-aware status reporting for monitoring
    and debugging across different deployment environments.
    
Test Strategy:
    - Request status in development environment without keys
    - Verify development-specific response format and warnings
    - Ensure environment context properly integrated
    
Success Criteria:
    - Development environment returns appropriate status information
    - Response includes development mode indicators and warnings
    - Environment context correctly identifies development deployment
    - Response format appropriate for development vs production

### test_auth_status_response_format_consistency_across_authentication_methods()

```python
def test_auth_status_response_format_consistency_across_authentication_methods(self, client, production_environment):
```

Test status response format consistent regardless of authentication method.

Integration Scope:
    Tests response formatting consistency across different authentication
    header types (Bearer vs X-API-Key) and validation methods.
    
Business Impact:
    Ensures consistent API client experience regardless of
    authentication method preference or requirements.
    
Test Strategy:
    - Test status endpoint with Bearer token authentication
    - Test same endpoint with X-API-Key header authentication  
    - Verify response format consistency between methods
    
Success Criteria:
    - Response structure identical between authentication methods
    - Key prefix and authentication status consistent
    - Only auth_method field differs between response types
    - No functional differences in endpoint behavior

### test_auth_status_secure_key_prefix_truncation()

```python
def test_auth_status_secure_key_prefix_truncation(self, client, multiple_api_keys_environment):
```

Test status endpoint securely truncates API key prefixes in responses.

Integration Scope:
    Tests secure response formatting that includes enough key information
    for verification while preventing key exposure or reconstruction.
    
Business Impact:
    Balances debugging utility with security by providing key
    identification without exposing sensitive authentication credentials.
    
Test Strategy:
    - Test status endpoint with various API keys of different lengths
    - Verify consistent truncation length and security
    - Ensure truncated prefixes provide useful identification
    
Success Criteria:
    - Key prefixes consistently truncated to safe length (8 chars)
    - Truncation prevents key reconstruction or exposure
    - Prefixes provide sufficient information for key identification
    - Truncation consistent across all configured keys
