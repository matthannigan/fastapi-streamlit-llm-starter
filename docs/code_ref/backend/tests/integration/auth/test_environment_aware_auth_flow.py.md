# Integration tests for environment-aware authentication flow.

  file_path: `backend/tests/integration/auth/test_environment_aware_auth_flow.py`

Tests the complete authentication flow from HTTP request through environment
detection, security policy enforcement, and HTTP response generation.

Seam Under Test:
    FastAPI → verify_api_key_http → EnvironmentDetector → HTTPException conversion

Critical Paths:
    - Production environment enforces API key requirements
    - Development environment allows optional authentication
    - Environment detection failure defaults to production security

## TestEnvironmentAwareAuthenticationFlow

Integration tests for environment-aware authentication flow.

Seam Under Test:
    HTTP Request → FastAPI Dependencies → Environment Detection → Security Policy → HTTP Response
    
Critical Paths:
    - Production environment requires valid API keys with proper HTTP errors
    - Development environment allows access while preserving authentication flow
    - Environment detection failures trigger production security as fallback

### test_production_environment_requires_valid_api_key_success()

```python
def test_production_environment_requires_valid_api_key_success(self, client, production_environment, auth_headers_valid):
```

Test production environment successfully authenticates valid API keys.

Integration Scope:
    Tests complete flow from HTTP request through environment detection,
    security policy enforcement, and successful authentication response.
    
Business Impact:
    Ensures users with valid API keys can access protected resources
    in production environments.
    
Test Strategy:
    - Set production environment with configured API key
    - Make authenticated request to auth status endpoint
    - Verify successful authentication and response content
    
Success Criteria:
    - Returns 200 status code indicating successful authentication
    - Response includes authenticated context and key information
    - No authentication errors or warnings in response

### test_production_environment_rejects_invalid_api_key_with_proper_http_error()

```python
def test_production_environment_rejects_invalid_api_key_with_proper_http_error(self, client, production_environment, auth_headers_invalid):
```

Test production environment returns proper 401 for invalid API keys.

Integration Scope:
    Tests authentication failure flow including custom exception creation,
    HTTP exception conversion, and structured error response generation.
    
Business Impact:
    Ensures unauthorized users receive clear, actionable error messages
    while protecting system security.
    
Test Strategy:
    - Configure production environment with valid API key
    - Attempt access with invalid API key
    - Verify proper 401 response with authentication challenge
    
Success Criteria:
    - Returns 401 Unauthorized status code
    - Includes WWW-Authenticate header for proper HTTP auth flow
    - Error response includes environment context and debugging information
    - No sensitive information exposed in error response

### test_production_environment_rejects_missing_credentials_with_auth_challenge()

```python
def test_production_environment_rejects_missing_credentials_with_auth_challenge(self, client, production_environment):
```

Test production environment requires credentials with proper authentication challenge.

Integration Scope:
    Tests missing credentials handling through dependency injection,
    authentication validation, and HTTP exception conversion.
    
Business Impact:
    Ensures production environments properly challenge unauthenticated
    requests with standard HTTP authentication flows.
    
Test Strategy:
    - Configure production environment with API keys
    - Make request without authentication headers
    - Verify proper 401 challenge response
    
Success Criteria:
    - Returns 401 Unauthorized for missing credentials
    - Includes proper WWW-Authenticate challenge header
    - Error message clearly indicates authentication requirement
    - Response includes environment context for debugging

### test_development_environment_allows_unauthenticated_access()

```python
def test_development_environment_allows_unauthenticated_access(self, client, development_environment):
```

Test development environment allows access without authentication.

Integration Scope:
    Tests development mode flow through environment detection,
    security policy determination, and development mode response.
    
Business Impact:
    Enables frictionless local development without requiring
    API key configuration while maintaining security awareness.
    
Test Strategy:
    - Configure development environment with no API keys
    - Make unauthenticated request to protected endpoint
    - Verify successful access with development mode indicators
    
Success Criteria:
    - Returns 200 status indicating successful access
    - Response indicates development mode operation
    - Includes appropriate warnings about development mode
    - Authentication context shows development mode status

### test_development_environment_authenticates_valid_keys_normally()

```python
def test_development_environment_authenticates_valid_keys_normally(self, client, development_with_keys_environment):
```

Test development environment with configured keys works normally.

Integration Scope:
    Tests mixed development configuration where environment is development
    but API keys are configured, ensuring normal authentication flow.
    
Business Impact:
    Supports development environments that choose to use authentication
    while maintaining development-appropriate behavior.
    
Test Strategy:
    - Configure development environment with API key
    - Make authenticated request with valid key
    - Verify normal authentication with development context
    
Success Criteria:
    - Returns 200 for valid authentication
    - Shows actual API key prefix (not "development")
    - Includes development environment context
    - Functions identically to production authentication

### test_environment_detection_failure_defaults_to_production_security()

```python
def test_environment_detection_failure_defaults_to_production_security(self, client, clean_environment, monkeypatch):
```

Test system defaults to production security when environment detection fails.

Integration Scope:
    Tests fallback behavior when environment detection service fails,
    ensuring system defaults to secure production mode.
    
Business Impact:
    Ensures system security is maintained even when environment
    detection fails, preventing accidental security bypasses.
    
Test Strategy:
    - Configure environment that causes detection failure
    - Attempt unauthenticated access
    - Verify system defaults to production security requirements
    
Success Criteria:
    - Requires authentication even with detection failure
    - Returns 401 for missing credentials
    - Error context indicates fallback to production security
    - System maintains secure defaults under failure conditions
