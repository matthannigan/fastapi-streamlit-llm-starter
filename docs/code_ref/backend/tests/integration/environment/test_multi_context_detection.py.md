# Multi-Context Environment Detection Integration Tests

  file_path: `backend/tests/integration/environment/test_multi_context_detection.py`

This module tests environment detection across different feature contexts (AI, Security,
Cache, Resilience), ensuring that each context provides appropriate metadata and
overrides while maintaining consistency across all dependent services.

HIGHEST PRIORITY - Core functionality that affects all dependent services
