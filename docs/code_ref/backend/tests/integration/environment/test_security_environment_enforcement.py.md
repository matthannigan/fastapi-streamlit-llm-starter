# Security Environment Enforcement Integration Tests

  file_path: `backend/tests/integration/environment/test_security_environment_enforcement.py`

This module tests security policy enforcement based on environment detection,
ensuring that authentication behavior correctly adapts to environment-specific
requirements and security contexts.

HIGHEST PRIORITY - Security critical, affects all authenticated requests

## TestSecurityEnvironmentEnforcement

Integration tests for security environment enforcement.

Seam Under Test:
    Environment Detection → Security Policy Enforcement → Authentication Behavior → API Access Control
    
Critical Paths:
    - Production environment → Strict security enforcement → API key validation → Access control
    - Development environment → Relaxed security → Development workflow → Local testing
    - Security context override → Environment-agnostic enforcement → Compliance requirements
    - Environment detection failure → Fail-secure behavior → Safe defaults
    
Business Impact:
    Ensures production environments enforce API key requirements while allowing
    development flexibility, with fail-secure defaults protecting against
    unauthorized access during environment detection failures

### test_production_environment_enforces_api_key_requirements()
