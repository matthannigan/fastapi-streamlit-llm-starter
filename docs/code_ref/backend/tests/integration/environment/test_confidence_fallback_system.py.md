# Environment Detection Confidence and Fallback Integration Tests

  file_path: `backend/tests/integration/environment/test_confidence_fallback_system.py`

This module tests service behavior under various confidence scenarios and
failure conditions, ensuring reliable environment detection even when primary
signals are unavailable and that all dependent services handle fallback gracefully.

HIGH PRIORITY - System reliability and operational safety

## TestEnvironmentDetectionConfidenceFallback

Integration tests for environment detection confidence and fallback systems.

Seam Under Test:
    Signal Collection → Confidence Analysis → Fallback Decision → Environment Determination → Service Behavior
    
Critical Paths:
    - High confidence signals → Normal operation → Service behavior
    - Low confidence signals → Fallback behavior → Safe defaults
    - Conflicting signals → Resolution logic → Consistent service behavior  
    - Detection failure → Recovery mechanisms → Service continuity
    
Business Impact:
    Ensures reliable environment detection even when primary signals are unavailable,
    with all dependent services handling uncertainty gracefully and failing safely
    rather than creating security vulnerabilities or service disruptions

```python
def test_service_recovery_when_detection_signals_become_available(self, clean_environment, reload_environment_module):
```

Test that services recover automatically when environment detection signals become available.

Integration Scope:
    Signal absence → Fallback behavior → Signal availability → Detection recovery → Service restoration
    
Business Impact:
    Ensures system automatically recovers from configuration issues without
    requiring restart when environment becomes properly detectable
    
Test Strategy:
    - Start with no clear environment signals
    - Verify fallback behavior is active
    - Add clear environment signals
    - Test that services recover automatically
    
Success Criteria:
    - Initial state uses fallback behavior
    - After signals are added, confidence increases
    - Services automatically adapt to new signals
    - Recovery happens within one detection cycle

### test_services_continue_operation_during_detection_failures()

```python
def test_services_continue_operation_during_detection_failures(self, clean_environment):
```

Test that services continue functioning when environment detection completely fails.

Integration Scope:
    Detection system failure → Service continuity → Error isolation → Graceful degradation
