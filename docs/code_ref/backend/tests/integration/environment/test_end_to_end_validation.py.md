# End-to-End Environment Validation Integration Tests

  file_path: `backend/tests/integration/environment/test_end_to_end_validation.py`

This module tests complete environment propagation from environment variables
to observable API behavior, validating that environment settings correctly
lead to the expected behavior in running services across the entire stack.

HIGH PRIORITY - Validates the complete chain from configuration to observable outcome

## TestEndToEndEnvironmentValidation

Integration tests for end-to-end environment validation.

Seam Under Test:
    Environment Variables → Environment Detection → All Dependent Services → Observable API Behavior
    
Critical Paths:
    - Environment setting → Full system behavior adaptation → API responses
    - Environment changes → Service adaptation → Consistent user experience
    - Failure scenarios → Safe defaults → System stability
    - Multi-service consistency → Unified environment view → Predictable behavior
    
Business Impact:
    Ensures that environment settings correctly propagate and lead to the expected
    behavior in running services, providing confidence that deployments work correctly
    across all environments and that users receive consistent, appropriate responses
