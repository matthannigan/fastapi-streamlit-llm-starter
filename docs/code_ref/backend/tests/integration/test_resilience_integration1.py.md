# Tests for resilience integration.

  file_path: `backend/tests/integration/test_resilience_integration1.py`
Need to combine old test_resilience_endpoints.py and test_preset_resilience_integration.py

This file currently only contains tests that were in test_resilience_endpoints.py

Comprehensive tests for resilience endpoints.
Tests all endpoints in app/resilience_endpoints.py
