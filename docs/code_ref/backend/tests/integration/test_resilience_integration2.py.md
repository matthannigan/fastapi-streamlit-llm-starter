# Tests for resilience integration.

  file_path: `backend/tests/integration/test_resilience_integration2.py`
Need to combine old test_resilience_endpoints.py and test_preset_resilience_integration.py

This file currently only contains tests that were in test_preset_resilience_integration.py

Integration tests for preset-resilience service integration.

Tests the complete flow from preset selection through resilience service
configuration, including operation-specific strategies, custom overrides,
and legacy configuration compatibility.
