# Test fixtures for CacheInterface unit tests.

  file_path: `backend/tests/unit/cache/base/conftest.py`

This module provides reusable fixtures following behavior-driven testing
principles. Since CacheInterface is an abstract base class with no external
dependencies (only standard library imports), there are no dependency mocks
required for testing the interface itself.

The fixtures here primarily provide test data and utilities for testing
concrete implementations of the CacheInterface contract.

Fixture Categories:
    - Interface compliance test utilities
    - Mock implementations for polymorphism testing

Design Philosophy:
    - CacheInterface has no external dependencies requiring mocking
    - Fixtures support testing interface compliance and polymorphic behavior
    - Test data fixtures are minimal since this is an abstract interface
    - Focus on testing that concrete implementations honor the contract

## interface_test_keys()

```python
def interface_test_keys():
```

Set of diverse cache keys for interface compliance testing.

Provides a variety of cache key patterns to test that concrete
implementations properly handle different key formats as allowed
by the CacheInterface contract.

## interface_test_values()

```python
def interface_test_values():
```

Set of diverse cache values for interface compliance testing.

Provides a variety of value types and structures to test that
concrete implementations properly handle different data types
as specified in the CacheInterface contract.

## interface_compliance_test_cases()

```python
def interface_compliance_test_cases():
```

Test cases for verifying CacheInterface contract compliance.

Provides a set of test scenarios that can be used to verify that
concrete implementations properly follow the CacheInterface contract
including behavior specifications from the docstrings.

## polymorphism_test_scenarios()

```python
def polymorphism_test_scenarios():
```

Test scenarios for verifying polymorphic usage of CacheInterface.

Provides test scenarios that verify code can work with any
CacheInterface implementation without knowing the specific
concrete type, ensuring the interface abstraction works correctly.
