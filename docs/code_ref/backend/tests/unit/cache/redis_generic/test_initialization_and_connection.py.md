  file_path: `backend/tests/unit/cache/redis_generic/test_initialization_and_connection.py`

This module provides systematic behavioral testing of the GenericRedisCache
initialization process, connection management, and configuration handling

Given: Configuration parameters with invalid values or types
When: GenericRedisCache initialization is attempted
Then: Appropriate configuration errors should be raised
And: Error messages should be specific and actionable
And: The initialization should fail gracefully

## TestRedisConnectionManagement

Test Redis connection establishment and lifecycle management.

The GenericRedisCache must reliably establish connections to Redis
and handle connection failures with appropriate fallback behavior.

### test_disconnect_functionality()

```python
async def test_disconnect_functionality(self, default_generic_redis_config, fake_redis_client):
```
