# Test fixtures for cache_validator module unit tests.

  file_path: `backend/tests/unit/cache/cache_validator/conftest.py`

This module provides reusable fixtures specific to cache validator testing.
The cache_validator module has no external dependencies requiring mocking,
as it only uses standard library components.

Note: This module exists for consistency with the testing structure,
but currently contains no fixtures as cache_validator has no external dependencies.
