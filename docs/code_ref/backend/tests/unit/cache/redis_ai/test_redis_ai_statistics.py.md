# Unit tests for AIResponseCache statistics and performance monitoring implementation.

  file_path: `backend/tests/unit/cache/redis_ai/test_redis_ai_statistics.py`

This test suite verifies the observable behaviors documented in the
AIResponseCache public contract. Tests focus on behavior-driven testing principles
and observable statistics collection and reporting functionality.

Implementation Status:
    - 8 tests PASS: All statistics and performance monitoring tests implemented and passing
    
Implementation Notes:
    All tests have been re-implemented using behavior-driven testing principles based strictly 
    on the public contract from backend/contracts/infrastructure/cache/redis_ai.pyi. 
    Key improvements:
    - Removed internal implementation mocking (e.g., cache.performance_monitor._calculate_hit_rate)
    - Test only documented behavior from public contract
    - Focus on observable outcomes rather than implementation details
    - Ensure tests would pass even if internal implementation is completely rewritten

Coverage Focus:
    - Statistics collection and reporting behavior verification
    - AI-specific analytics and text tier analysis
    - Operation performance metrics aggregation
    - Error handling for statistics collection failures

External Dependencies:
    All external dependencies use real fixtures from conftest.py following
    behavior-driven testing principles for accurate behavior simulation.
