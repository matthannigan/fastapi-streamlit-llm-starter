# Tests for environment detection error handling and edge cases.

  file_path: `backend/tests/unit/environment/test_error_handling.py`

Tests error resilience including invalid parameters, system access failures,
regex errors, and graceful degradation. Ensures detection continues working
when individual mechanisms fail.

## TestEnvironmentDetectorErrorHandling

Test suite for error handling and edge cases in environment detection.

Scope:
    - Invalid parameter handling and validation
    - System error resilience (file system, environment access)
    - Graceful degradation when detection mechanisms fail

Business Critical:
    Error handling ensures environment detection remains operational
    even when individual detection mechanisms fail or invalid input is provided

### test_detect_with_context_validates_feature_context_parameter()

```python
def test_detect_with_context_validates_feature_context_parameter(self, environment_detector):
```

Test that detect_with_context validates FeatureContext parameter type.

Verifies:
    Invalid FeatureContext parameters are handled appropriately.

Business Impact:
    Prevents runtime errors from invalid feature context usage.

Scenario:
    Given: EnvironmentDetector instance
    When: Calling detect_with_context with invalid FeatureContext
    Then: Either raises appropriate exception or handles gracefully

Fixtures Used:
    - environment_detector: EnvironmentDetector with default configuration

### test_detection_handles_file_system_access_errors()

```python
def test_detection_handles_file_system_access_errors(self, environment_detector, mock_file_system_errors):
```

Test that detection handles file system access errors gracefully.

Verifies:
    File system errors during indicator checking don't break detection.

Business Impact:
    Ensures detection continues working even with restricted file system access.

Scenario:
    Given: EnvironmentDetector with file system access restrictions
    When: Running detection that attempts to check file indicators
    Then: Detection completes successfully with alternative signals

Fixtures Used:
    - environment_detector: EnvironmentDetector with default configuration
    - mock_file_system_errors: File system that raises errors on access attempts

### test_detection_handles_environment_variable_access_errors()

```python
def test_detection_handles_environment_variable_access_errors(self, environment_detector, mock_env_access_errors):
```

Test that detection handles environment variable access errors gracefully.

Verifies:
    Environment variable access errors don't prevent detection completion.

Business Impact:
    Ensures detection works even with restricted environment access.

Scenario:
    Given: EnvironmentDetector with environment variable access restrictions
    When: Running detection that attempts to read environment variables
    Then: Detection completes successfully with alternative detection methods

Fixtures Used:
    - environment_detector: EnvironmentDetector with default configuration
    - mock_env_access_errors: Environment that raises errors on variable access

### test_detection_handles_regex_pattern_errors_gracefully()

```python
def test_detection_handles_regex_pattern_errors_gracefully(self, mock_problematic_hostname, invalid_patterns_config):
```

Test that detection handles regex pattern matching errors gracefully.

Verifies:
    Malformed regex patterns or matching errors don't break detection.

Business Impact:
    Prevents configuration errors from causing detection failures.

Scenario:
    Given: EnvironmentDetector with potentially problematic regex patterns
    When: Running detection with hostname that could cause regex errors
    Then: Detection completes successfully, ignoring problematic patterns

Fixtures Used:
    - environment_detector: EnvironmentDetector with edge-case regex patterns
    - mock_problematic_hostname: Hostname values that could trigger regex issues

### test_detection_provides_meaningful_error_messages()

```python
def test_detection_provides_meaningful_error_messages(self, environment_detector, mock_error_conditions):
```

Test that detection provides clear error messages when failures occur.

Verifies:
    Error conditions include helpful debugging information.

Business Impact:
    Enables quick diagnosis and resolution of detection configuration issues.

Scenario:
    Given: EnvironmentDetector with conditions that cause detectable errors
    When: Running detection that encounters error conditions
    Then: Error messages provide clear information about failure cause and resolution

Fixtures Used:
    - environment_detector: EnvironmentDetector with error-prone configuration
    - mock_error_conditions: Environment conditions designed to trigger specific errors

### test_detection_maintains_partial_functionality_during_errors()

```python
def test_detection_maintains_partial_functionality_during_errors(self, environment_detector, mock_partial_failure_conditions):
```

Test that detection maintains partial functionality when some mechanisms fail.

Verifies:
    Detection continues working even when individual signal sources fail.

Business Impact:
    Ensures detection resilience and availability in production environments.

Scenario:
    Given: EnvironmentDetector with some signal sources configured to fail
    When: Running detection with partially failed detection mechanisms
    Then: Detection completes using available signals and indicates reduced confidence

Fixtures Used:
    - environment_detector: EnvironmentDetector with default configuration
    - mock_partial_failure_conditions: Environment with some detection mechanisms failing
