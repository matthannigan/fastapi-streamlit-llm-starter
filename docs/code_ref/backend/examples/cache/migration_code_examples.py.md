# Migration Code Examples: Before/After Patterns

  file_path: `backend/examples/cache/migration_code_examples.py`

This module provides concrete before/after code examples for migrating from

practical migration strategies for different application patterns.

## Migration Areas Covered

- Environment-based selection to explicit configuration
- FastAPI dependency injection updates
- Environment variable migration
- Test fixture migration to for_testing() method
- Health check endpoint conversion
