# Advanced Infrastructure Services Demo

  file_path: `backend/examples/advanced_infrastructure_demo.py`

This script demonstrates advanced usage of the infrastructure services available in the 
FastAPI Streamlit LLM Starter project. It showcases:

1. AIResponseCache with custom configurations and monitoring
2. Resilience patterns (circuit breakers, retries) with different strategies
3. AI infrastructure (prompt building, input sanitization)
4. Performance monitoring and metrics collection
5. Security features (authentication, input validation)
6. Error handling and graceful degradation

This serves as both a learning example and a practical guide for implementing
robust AI service operations with comprehensive infrastructure support.

## AdvancedInfrastructureDemo

Comprehensive demonstration of advanced infrastructure usage patterns.

This class showcases real-world scenarios where multiple infrastructure
components work together to provide a robust, monitored, and secure
AI service implementation.
