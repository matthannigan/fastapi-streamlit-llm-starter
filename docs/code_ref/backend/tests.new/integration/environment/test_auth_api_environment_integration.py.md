# Authentication Status API Environment Integration Tests

  file_path: `backend/tests.new/integration/environment/test_auth_api_environment_integration.py`

This module tests the integration between the authentication status API endpoint
and environment detection, ensuring that authentication status responses include
environment context and adapt to the detected environment.

MEDIUM PRIORITY - API functionality and monitoring

## TestAuthAPIEnvironmentIntegration

    - Test auth status response
    - Verify confidence is reflected in response behavior

Success Criteria:
    - High confidence detection leads to confident API responses
    - API behavior adapts to detection confidence levels
    - Response formatting reflects detection certainty

### test_auth_status_with_feature_specific_contexts()

```python
def test_auth_status_with_feature_specific_contexts(self, production_environment):
```

Test auth status with feature-specific contexts.

Integration Scope:
    Feature context → Environment detection → Auth response → Context-aware formatting

Business Impact:
    Ensures feature contexts influence auth status responses

Test Strategy:
    - Set production environment
    - Test auth status with security enforcement context
    - Verify security-aware response formatting

Success Criteria:
    - Security context affects auth status response
    - Context-specific response formatting is applied
    - Feature metadata is reflected in response

### test_auth_status_error_responses_include_environment_context()

```python
def test_auth_status_error_responses_include_environment_context(self, clean_environment):
```

Test that auth status error responses include environment detection information.

Integration Scope:
    Error handling → Environment detection → Error response formatting

Business Impact:
    Ensures error responses provide environment context for debugging

Test Strategy:
    - Test auth status with invalid credentials
    - Verify error response includes environment information
    - Test that environment context aids troubleshooting

Success Criteria:
    - Error responses include environment detection context
    - Environment information aids error diagnosis
    - Error formatting adapts to environment

### test_auth_status_response_consistency_across_requests()

```python
def test_auth_status_response_consistency_across_requests(self, production_environment):
```

Test that auth status responses are consistent across multiple requests.

Integration Scope:
    Multiple requests → Environment detection → Consistent responses

Business Impact:
    Ensures deterministic API behavior for same environment

Test Strategy:
    - Make multiple auth status requests
    - Verify consistent environment detection
    - Test response consistency across requests

Success Criteria:
    - Same environment produces consistent responses
