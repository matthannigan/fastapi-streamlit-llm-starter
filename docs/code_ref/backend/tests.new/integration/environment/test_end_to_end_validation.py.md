# End-to-End Environment Validation Integration Tests

  file_path: `backend/tests.new/integration/environment/test_end_to_end_validation.py`

This module tests the complete chain of behavior from configuration to observable outcome,
validating that environment settings correctly propagate through the entire system to
produce expected behavior in security, cache, and resilience components.

HIGH PRIORITY - Validates the complete chain of behavior from configuration to observable outcome

## TestEndToEndEnvironmentValidation

End-to-end integration tests for environment-driven behavior.
