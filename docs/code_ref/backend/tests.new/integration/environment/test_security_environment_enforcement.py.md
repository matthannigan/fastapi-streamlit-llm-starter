# Security Environment Enforcement Integration Tests

  file_path: `backend/tests.new/integration/environment/test_security_environment_enforcement.py`

This module tests the integration between environment detection and security enforcement,
ensuring that production environments properly enforce API key requirements while
allowing development environments to be more permissive.

HIGH PRIORITY - Security critical, affects all authenticated requests

## TestSecurityEnvironmentEnforcement

Integration tests for security environment enforcement.

Seam Under Test:
    Environment Detection → Security Authentication → API Key Enforcement

Critical Path:
    Environment detection → Production security rules → API key validation

Business Impact:
    Ensures production environments enforce API key requirements while
    allowing development flexibility for faster iteration

Test Strategy:
    - Test production environment enforces API keys
    - Test development environment allows requests without keys
    - Test environment detection failure defaults to secure mode
    - Test feature-specific security context overrides

### test_production_environment_enforces_api_keys()

```python
def test_production_environment_enforces_api_keys(self, production_environment):
```

Test that production environment enforces API key requirements.

Integration Scope:
    Environment detection → Security authentication → API key validation

Business Impact:
    Ensures production environments are secure by default

Test Strategy:
    - Set production environment
    - Attempt to initialize auth without API keys
    - Verify ConfigurationError is raised

Success Criteria:
    - ConfigurationError raised in production without API keys
    - Error message clearly indicates security requirement
    - Environment detection correctly identifies production

### test_development_environment_allows_no_api_keys()

```python
def test_development_environment_allows_no_api_keys(self, development_environment):
```

Test that development environment allows initialization without API keys.

Integration Scope:
    Environment detection → Security authentication → Flexible development mode

Business Impact:
    Allows faster development iteration without API key management

Test Strategy:
    - Set development environment
    - Initialize auth without API keys
    - Verify successful initialization

Success Criteria:
    - Auth system initializes successfully in development
    - Environment detection correctly identifies development
    - Development mode allows all API keys (permissive)

### test_security_enforcement_context_overrides_to_production()

```python
def test_security_enforcement_context_overrides_to_production(self, security_enforcement_environment):
```

Test that security enforcement context can override environment detection.

Integration Scope:
    Feature context → Environment override → Security enforcement

Business Impact:
    Allows security-conscious deployments to enforce production rules
    even in non-production environments

Test Strategy:
    - Set development environment with security enforcement enabled
    - Verify environment detection with security context
    - Test that security requirements are enforced

Success Criteria:
    - Security context returns production environment
    - API key requirements enforced despite development setting
    - Override provides clear reasoning for security decision

### test_ai_context_in_production_with_security_requirements()

```python
def test_ai_context_in_production_with_security_requirements(self, prod_with_ai_features):
```

Test AI context in production environment maintains security requirements.

Integration Scope:
    Production environment + AI features → Security enforcement → API key validation

Business Impact:
    Ensures AI features don't compromise production security

Test Strategy:
    - Set production environment with AI features enabled
    - Verify environment detection with AI context
    - Test that security requirements are still enforced

Success Criteria:
    - AI context returns production environment
    - API key requirements still enforced in production
    - AI-specific metadata is preserved

### test_environment_detection_failure_defaults_to_secure_mode()

```python
def test_environment_detection_failure_defaults_to_secure_mode(self, clean_environment):
```

Test that environment detection failures default to secure production mode.

Integration Scope:
    Environment detection failure → Fallback security → Production defaults

Business Impact:
    Ensures system fails securely when environment cannot be determined

Test Strategy:
    - Create scenario with no environment indicators
    - Verify environment detection with low confidence
    - Test that security defaults to production mode

Success Criteria:
    - Unknown environment detected with low confidence
    - Security enforcement defaults to production requirements
    - System fails securely rather than allowing bypass

### test_authentication_status_endpoint_environment_awareness()

```python
def test_authentication_status_endpoint_environment_awareness(self):
```

Test that authentication status endpoint reflects environment detection.

Integration Scope:
    HTTP API → Authentication → Environment detection → Response formatting

Business Impact:
    Provides environment-aware authentication status for client applications

Test Strategy:
    - Test auth status endpoint in different environments
    - Verify environment context in response
    - Test API key prefix truncation based on environment

Success Criteria:
    - Response includes detected environment context
    - API key prefix differs between environments
    - Environment detection confidence reflected in response

### test_convenience_functions_environment_awareness()

```python
def test_convenience_functions_environment_awareness(self, production_environment):
```

Test that convenience functions correctly reflect environment detection.

Integration Scope:
    Environment convenience functions → Detection service → Boolean results

Business Impact:
    Provides simple boolean checks for common environment scenarios

Test Strategy:
    - Test is_production_environment() in production
    - Test is_development_environment() in development
    - Test confidence thresholds for decision making

Success Criteria:
    - is_production_environment() returns True in production
    - is_development_environment() returns True in development
    - Functions respect confidence thresholds (>0.60)

### test_environment_detection_with_mixed_signals()

```python
def test_environment_detection_with_mixed_signals(self, clean_environment):
```

Test environment detection with conflicting environment signals.

Integration Scope:
    Multiple signal sources → Conflict resolution → Final environment determination

Business Impact:
    Ensures reliable environment detection even with conflicting indicators

Test Strategy:
    - Set conflicting environment variables
    - Verify signal collection and confidence scoring
    - Test conflict resolution logic

Success Criteria:
    - Conflicting signals are collected and scored
    - Highest confidence signal wins
    - Reasoning explains the conflict resolution

### test_environment_detection_service_availability()

```python
def test_environment_detection_service_availability(self, mock_environment_detection_failure):
```

Test system behavior when environment detection service fails.

Integration Scope:
    Service failure → Error handling → Fallback behavior → System stability

Business Impact:
    Ensures system remains stable when environment detection is unavailable

Test Strategy:
    - Mock environment detection service to fail
    - Test component behavior under failure
    - Verify graceful degradation

Success Criteria:
    - System handles detection failure gracefully
    - Appropriate error handling and logging
