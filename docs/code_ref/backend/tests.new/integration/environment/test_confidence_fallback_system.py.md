# Environment Detection Confidence and Fallback Integration Tests

  file_path: `backend/tests.new/integration/environment/test_confidence_fallback_system.py`

This module tests the confidence scoring system and fallback mechanisms in environment
detection, ensuring robust operation even when environment signals are conflicting,
missing, or ambiguous.

HIGH PRIORITY - System reliability and operational safety

## TestEnvironmentDetectionConfidenceAndFallback

Integration tests for environment detection confidence and fallback systems.

Seam Under Test:
