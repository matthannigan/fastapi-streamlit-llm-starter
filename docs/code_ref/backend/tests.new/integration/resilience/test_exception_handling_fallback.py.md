# Integration Tests: Exception Classification → Retry Strategy → Fallback Execution

  file_path: `backend/tests.new/integration/resilience/test_exception_handling_fallback.py`

This module tests the integration between exception classification, retry strategy
selection, and fallback execution mechanisms. It validates that the system correctly
classifies different types of exceptions and applies appropriate resilience strategies.

Integration Scope:
    - Exception classification → Retry strategy selection → Fallback mechanism
    - Transient vs permanent error handling → Retry decisions → Graceful degradation
    - Error context preservation → Retry execution → Result handling

Business Impact:
    Ensures appropriate error handling and graceful degradation for user experience,
    providing reliable service operation under various failure conditions

Test Strategy:
    - Test exception classification for different error types
    - Validate retry strategy application based on exception type
    - Test fallback execution when retries are exhausted
    - Verify error context preservation across retry attempts
    - Test graceful degradation patterns

Critical Paths:
    - Exception occurrence → Classification → Retry decision → Fallback execution
    - Error context preservation → Retry attempts → Result handling
    - Service degradation → Fallback response → User experience
