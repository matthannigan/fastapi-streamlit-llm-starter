# Integration Tests: Circuit Breaker State Management → Health Checks → Recovery

  file_path: `backend/tests.new/integration/resilience/test_circuit_breaker_recovery.py`

This module tests the integration between circuit breaker state management, health check
reporting, and automatic recovery mechanisms. It validates that circuit breakers properly
transition between states, report accurate health status, and recover from failures.

Integration Scope:
    - EnhancedCircuitBreaker → State management → Health reporting
    - Failure detection → State transitions → Recovery orchestration
    - Health checks → Monitoring integration → Operational visibility

Business Impact:
    Critical for system availability and automatic recovery during failures,
    ensuring operational visibility and preventing cascade failures

Test Strategy:
    - Test complete state transition cycles (closed → open → half-open → closed)
    - Validate health check reporting accuracy for different states
    - Test automatic recovery mechanisms and timing
    - Verify state persistence and monitoring integration
    - Test concurrent access to circuit breaker state

Critical Paths:
    - Failure detection → State management → Health reporting
    - Recovery orchestration → State transitions → System restoration
    - Health monitoring → Alert generation → Operational response
