# Environment-Aware Security Enforcement Integration Tests

  file_path: `backend/tests.new/integration/auth/test_environment_security.py`

HIGH PRIORITY - Security critical, affects all authentication decisions

INTEGRATION SCOPE:
    Tests collaboration between APIKeyAuth, EnvironmentDetector, AuthConfig, and get_environment_info
    components for environment-driven security policy enforcement.

SEAM UNDER TEST:
    APIKeyAuth → EnvironmentDetector → AuthConfig → Security enforcement

CRITICAL PATH:
    Environment detection → Security configuration → Authentication enforcement → Access control

BUSINESS IMPACT:
    Ensures appropriate security enforcement based on deployment environment, preventing
    misconfigurations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.

TEST STRATEGY:
    - Test production environments requiring API keys
    - Test development environments allowing unauthenticated access
    - Test environment detection failures and fallback behavior
    - Test security policy enforcement based on environment confidence
    - Test environment variable precedence and configuration rules

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
    - Production environments enforce API key requirements
    - Development environments allow bypass when no keys configured
    - Environment detection failures default to secure behavior
    - Security policies correctly applied based on environment context
    - Environment variable configuration properly respected

## TestEnvironmentAwareSecurityEnforcement

Integration tests for environment-aware security enforcement.

Seam Under Test:
    APIKeyAuth initialization → EnvironmentDetector → AuthConfig → Security policy

Business Impact:
    Critical security functionality ensuring appropriate authentication based on environment

### test_development_environment_with_no_api_keys_allows_initialization()

```python
def test_development_environment_with_no_api_keys_allows_initialization(self):
```

Test that development environment with no API keys allows system initialization.

Integration Scope:
    APIKeyAuth → EnvironmentDetector → AuthConfig → Security validation

Business Impact:
    Enables development workflow without authentication overhead

Test Strategy:
    - Configure development environment with no API keys
    - Mock environment detection to return development
    - Verify APIKeyAuth initializes successfully
    - Confirm development mode bypass

Success Criteria:
    - APIKeyAuth initializes without raising ConfigurationError
    - Development mode allows bypass of security requirements
    - System enters development mode when no keys configured

### test_basic_authentication_initialization_works()

```python
def test_basic_authentication_initialization_works(self, clean_environment):
```

Test that basic authentication initialization works correctly.

Integration Scope:
    APIKeyAuth → AuthConfig → Basic initialization

Business Impact:
    Ensures authentication system initializes properly in basic scenarios

Test Strategy:
    - Initialize APIKeyAuth in development mode
    - Verify basic functionality works
    - Confirm system initializes without errors

Success Criteria:
    - APIKeyAuth initializes successfully
    - Basic authentication functionality works
    - System is ready for authentication operations

### test_development_environment_without_api_keys_allows_initialization()

```python
def test_development_environment_without_api_keys_allows_initialization(self, development_environment):
```

Test that development environment without API keys allows initialization.

Integration Scope:
    APIKeyAuth → EnvironmentDetector → AuthConfig → Security validation

Business Impact:
    Enables local development without authentication overhead

Test Strategy:
    - Configure development environment without API keys
    - Initialize APIKeyAuth system
    - Verify initialization succeeds
    - Confirm development mode behavior

Success Criteria:
    - APIKeyAuth initializes successfully in development
    - No API keys are loaded
    - System enters development mode

### test_api_key_validation_works_correctly()

```python
def test_api_key_validation_works_correctly(self, clean_environment, monkeypatch):
```

Test that API key validation works correctly.

Integration Scope:
    APIKeyAuth → Key validation → Authentication checking

Business Impact:
    Ensures API key validation functions properly

Test Strategy:
    - Create APIKeyAuth instance with test keys
    - Test key validation with valid and invalid keys
    - Verify validation logic works correctly

Success Criteria:
    - Valid API keys are accepted
    - Invalid API keys are rejected
    - Validation logic works as expected

### test_authentication_configuration_loads_correctly()

```python
def test_authentication_configuration_loads_correctly(self, clean_environment):
```

Test that authentication configuration loads correctly from environment variables.

Integration Scope:
    AuthConfig → Environment variables → Configuration loading → Settings validation

Business Impact:
    Ensures authentication configuration is properly loaded and applied

Test Strategy:
    - Set authentication configuration environment variables
    - Initialize AuthConfig and verify settings are loaded
    - Confirm configuration values match environment variables

Success Criteria:
    - Authentication configuration loads from environment variables
    - Configuration values are applied correctly
    - Settings are accessible through AuthConfig instance

### test_authentication_configuration_supports_advanced_mode()

```python
def test_authentication_configuration_supports_advanced_mode(self, clean_environment):
```

Test that authentication configuration supports advanced mode features.

Integration Scope:
    AuthConfig → Advanced mode → Feature flags → Configuration validation

Business Impact:
    Ensures advanced authentication features can be properly configured

Test Strategy:
    - Configure advanced authentication mode
    - Verify advanced features are enabled
    - Confirm feature flag functionality works

Success Criteria:
    - Advanced mode configuration works correctly
    - Advanced features are properly enabled
    - Feature flags function as expected
