# HIGH PRIORITY: Configuration → Operation-Specific Strategies → Execution Integration Test

  file_path: `backend/tests.new/integration/text_processor/test_configuration_management.py`

This test suite verifies the integration between configuration management, operation-specific
resilience strategies, and processing execution. It ensures that configuration settings are
properly loaded, validated, and applied to determine resilience behavior.

Integration Scope:
    Tests the complete configuration flow from environment variables and settings
    through resilience strategy selection to processing execution.

Seam Under Test:
    Settings → ResilienceStrategy selection → Operation configuration → AI processing

Critical Paths:
    - Environment configuration → Strategy resolution → Operation-specific settings → Processing execution
    - Configuration validation and error handling
    - Dynamic configuration updates during runtime

Business Impact:
    Configuration correctness affects all processing behavior and system reliability.
    Incorrect configuration leads to inappropriate resilience behavior affecting system performance.

Test Strategy:
    - Test environment-specific configuration loading (development vs production)
    - Verify operation-specific resilience strategy selection
    - Test custom configuration override behavior
    - Validate configuration validation and error handling
    - Test dynamic configuration updates and runtime changes

Success Criteria:
    - Environment-specific settings load correctly
    - Operation-specific strategies are selected appropriately
    - Custom configuration overrides work as expected
    - Configuration validation prevents invalid configurations
    - Dynamic updates are handled gracefully
