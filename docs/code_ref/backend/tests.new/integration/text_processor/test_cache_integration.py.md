# MEDIUM PRIORITY: TextProcessorService → Cache → AI Services Integration Test

  file_path: `backend/tests.new/integration/text_processor/test_cache_integration.py`

This test suite verifies the integration between TextProcessorService, cache infrastructure,
and AI services. It ensures that caching works correctly to improve performance and reduce
AI API costs while maintaining data integrity and freshness.
