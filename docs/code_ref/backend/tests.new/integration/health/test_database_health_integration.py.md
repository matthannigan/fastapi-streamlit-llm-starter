# Integration tests for database health monitoring.

  file_path: `backend/tests.new/integration/health/test_database_health_integration.py`

These tests verify the integration between HealthChecker and database connectivity,
ensuring proper monitoring of database availability and connectivity validation.
Note: Currently testing placeholder implementation.

MEDIUM PRIORITY - Data persistence monitoring (currently placeholder)

## TestDatabaseHealthIntegration

Integration tests for database health monitoring.

Seam Under Test:
