    - Mock settings with missing/empty Gemini API key
    - Register AI model health check with health checker
    - Execute health check and validate degraded status
    - Verify missing API key is properly detected and reported

Success Criteria:
    - Health check returns DEGRADED status without API key
    - Clear indication of missing API key in message
    - Metadata accurately reflects missing credentials
    - Response time remains reasonable despite degraded state

### test_ai_model_health_integration_with_api_key_validation()

```python
def test_ai_model_health_integration_with_api_key_validation(self, health_checker, settings_with_gemini_key):
```

Test AI model health monitoring with API key validation logic.

    and structure, providing early detection of configuration
    issues that could cause AI service failures.

Test Strategy:
    - Mock settings with various API key formats
    - Register AI model health check with health checker
    - Execute health check and validate format validation
    - Verify proper handling of different API key states

Success Criteria:
    - API key validation works correctly for different formats
    - Health status reflects actual API key usability
    - Metadata provides detailed API key information
    - Response time includes validation overhead

### test_ai_model_health_integration_with_provider_metadata()

```python
