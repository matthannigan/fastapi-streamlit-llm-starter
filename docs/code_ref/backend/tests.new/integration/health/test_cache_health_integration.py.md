# Integration tests for cache system health monitoring.

  file_path: `backend/tests.new/integration/health/test_cache_health_integration.py`

These tests verify the integration between HealthChecker and AIResponseCache,
ensuring proper health status reporting, performance monitoring integration,
and graceful degradation when cache components fail.

HIGH PRIORITY - Core infrastructure monitoring, affects system performance visibility

## TestCacheSystemHealthIntegration

Integration tests for cache system health monitoring.

Seam Under Test:
    HealthChecker → AIResponseCache → CachePerformanceMonitor

Critical Path:
    Health check registration → Cache connectivity validation →
    Performance metrics collection → Status aggregation

Business Impact:
    Ensures cache system health monitoring provides accurate performance insights
    and enables early detection of cache-related performance issues.

Test Strategy:
    - Verify cache service connectivity validation
    - Test performance monitoring integration
    - Confirm graceful degradation with cache failures
    - Validate health check response times and metadata
    - Test both Redis and memory-only cache scenarios

Success Criteria:
    - Cache health checks complete successfully under normal conditions
    - Performance metrics are collected and integrated correctly
    - System reports appropriate status when cache components fail
    - Health check response times are reasonable (<100ms)
    - Cache metadata provides useful operational insights

### test_cache_health_integration_with_redis_and_performance_monitor()

```python
def test_cache_health_integration_with_redis_and_performance_monitor(self, health_checker, fake_redis_cache, performance_monitor):
```

Test cache health integration with Redis backend and performance monitoring.

Integration Scope:
    HealthChecker → AIResponseCache → FakeStrictRedis → CachePerformanceMonitor

Business Impact:
    Verifies that cache system health monitoring works correctly with
    real Redis infrastructure and performance tracking, ensuring operators
    can monitor cache performance in production environments.

Test Strategy:
    - Set up cache with Redis backend and performance monitor
    - Register cache health check with health checker
    - Execute health check and validate comprehensive status
    - Verify performance metrics are collected and integrated

Success Criteria:
    - Health check returns HEALTHY status with Redis connectivity
    - Performance metrics are collected and available
    - Cache metadata includes Redis status information
    - Response time is reasonable for monitoring frequency

### test_cache_health_integration_with_memory_only_fallback()

```python
def test_cache_health_integration_with_memory_only_fallback(self, health_checker, fake_redis_cache, performance_monitor):
```

Test cache health when Redis is unavailable but memory cache works.

Integration Scope:
    HealthChecker → AIResponseCache → Memory cache fallback

Business Impact:
    Ensures graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable,
    allowing system to continue operating with memory-only caching
    while alerting operators to the degraded state.

Test Strategy:
    - Simulate Redis connection failure
    - Verify system falls back to memory-only mode
    - Confirm health check reports degraded status
    - Validate that basic caching still functions

Success Criteria:
    - Health check returns DEGRADED status when Redis unavailable
    - Memory cache remains operational
    - Clear indication of which component failed
    - Response time still reasonable despite fallback

### test_cache_health_integration_with_performance_monitoring_disabled()

```python
def test_cache_health_integration_with_performance_monitoring_disabled(self, health_checker, fake_redis_cache):
```

Test cache health when performance monitoring is not available.

Integration Scope:
    HealthChecker → AIResponseCache → Cache without performance monitor

Business Impact:
    Ensures cache health monitoring works even when performance
    monitoring is disabled or unavailable, maintaining basic
    connectivity monitoring capabilities.

Test Strategy:
    - Configure cache without performance monitor
    - Execute health check and verify basic functionality
    - Confirm system reports degraded monitoring capability
    - Validate that core cache functionality still works

Success Criteria:
    - Health check completes without performance monitor
    - Cache connectivity is still validated
    - Clear indication of monitoring limitations
    - Response time remains reasonable

### test_cache_health_integration_comprehensive_stats_collection()

```python
def test_cache_health_integration_comprehensive_stats_collection(self, health_checker, fake_redis_cache, performance_monitor):
```

Test comprehensive cache statistics collection and reporting.

Integration Scope:
    HealthChecker → AIResponseCache → Performance monitoring data collection

Business Impact:
    Ensures operators receive comprehensive cache performance
    insights for capacity planning, performance optimization,
    and troubleshooting cache-related issues.

Test Strategy:
    - Configure cache with performance monitor and sample data
    - Execute health check and validate stats collection
    - Verify all relevant metrics are captured and reported
    - Confirm metadata includes operational insights

Success Criteria:
    - Performance statistics are collected and available
    - Cache metadata includes comprehensive operational data
    - Health check response provides actionable insights
    - Response time includes performance monitoring overhead

### test_cache_health_integration_with_cache_service_dependency_injection()

```python
def test_cache_health_integration_with_cache_service_dependency_injection(self, health_checker, fake_redis_cache, performance_monitor):
```

Test cache health integration using dependency injection pattern.

Integration Scope:
    HealthChecker → Dependency-injected cache service → Health validation

Business Impact:
    Verifies that health monitoring can work with dependency-injected
    cache services, enabling proper service lifecycle management
    and avoiding the performance issue noted in check_cache_health().

Test Strategy:
    - Create health check function that accepts cache service as parameter
    - Register with dependency injection pattern
    - Verify health check uses injected service correctly
    - Confirm proper service lifecycle management

Success Criteria:
    - Health check accepts and uses dependency-injected cache service
    - No redundant cache service instantiation occurs
    - Health validation works correctly with injected service
    - Response time is optimal due to service reuse
