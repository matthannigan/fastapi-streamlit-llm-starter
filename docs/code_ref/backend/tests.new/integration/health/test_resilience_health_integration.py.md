# Integration tests for resilience system health monitoring.

  file_path: `backend/tests.new/integration/health/test_resilience_health_integration.py`

These tests verify the integration between HealthChecker and the resilience
infrastructure, ensuring proper monitoring of circuit breakers, retry patterns,
and resilience system status.

HIGH PRIORITY - Critical for system reliability and failure detection

## TestResilienceSystemHealthIntegration

Integration tests for resilience system health monitoring.

Seam Under Test:
    HealthChecker → AIServiceResilience → Circuit Breaker → Metrics

Critical Path:
    Health check registration → Resilience service validation →
    Circuit breaker status → Metrics aggregation

Business Impact:
    Ensures resilience patterns are properly monitored and failures
    are detected before they impact system reliability and user experience.

Test Strategy:
    - Test circuit breaker state monitoring and reporting
    - Verify resilience metrics collection and integration
    - Confirm proper handling of resilience system failures
    - Validate health status determination based on resilience state
    - Test both healthy and degraded resilience scenarios

Success Criteria:
    - Resilience health checks detect open circuit breakers correctly
    - Metrics collection works without disrupting resilience operations
    - System reports appropriate health status based on resilience state
    - Response times are reasonable for frequent monitoring
    - Metadata provides actionable insights for operators

### test_resilience_health_integration_with_healthy_circuit_breakers()

```python
def test_resilience_health_integration_with_healthy_circuit_breakers(self, health_checker, mock_resilience_service):
```

Test resilience health monitoring with all circuit breakers closed.

Integration Scope:
    HealthChecker → Resilience orchestrator → Circuit breaker metrics

Business Impact:
    Verifies that resilience monitoring correctly reports healthy
    system state when circuit breakers are operating normally,
    providing operators with confidence in system reliability.

Test Strategy:
    - Mock resilience service with healthy circuit breaker status
    - Register resilience health check with health checker
    - Execute health check and validate healthy status reporting
    - Verify metrics collection doesn't interfere with resilience

Success Criteria:
    - Health check returns HEALTHY status for normal operation
    - Circuit breaker metrics are collected successfully
    - Metadata includes comprehensive circuit breaker information
    - Response time is reasonable for monitoring frequency

### test_resilience_health_integration_with_open_circuit_breakers()

```python
def test_resilience_health_integration_with_open_circuit_breakers(self, health_checker, mock_unhealthy_resilience_service):
```

Test resilience health monitoring when circuit breakers are open.

Integration Scope:
    HealthChecker → Resilience orchestrator → Failed circuit breakers

Business Impact:
    Ensures that resilience monitoring correctly detects and reports
    when circuit breakers are open, enabling operators to identify
    failing services before they impact user experience.

Test Strategy:
    - Mock resilience service with open circuit breakers
    - Register resilience health check with health checker
    - Execute health check and validate degraded status reporting
    - Verify open circuit breaker information is captured

Success Criteria:
    - Health check returns DEGRADED status when breakers are open
    - Open circuit breaker names are captured in metadata
    - Clear indication of which services are experiencing issues
    - Response time remains reasonable despite degraded state

### test_resilience_health_integration_with_metrics_collection()

```python
def test_resilience_health_integration_with_metrics_collection(self, health_checker, mock_resilience_service):
```

Test comprehensive resilience metrics collection and reporting.

Integration Scope:
    HealthChecker → Resilience orchestrator → Metrics aggregation

Business Impact:
    Ensures operators receive comprehensive resilience performance
    insights for capacity planning, failure analysis, and
    resilience pattern optimization.

Test Strategy:
    - Mock resilience service with detailed metrics
    - Register resilience health check with health checker
    - Execute health check and validate metrics collection
    - Verify all relevant resilience metrics are captured

Success Criteria:
    - Comprehensive metrics are collected from resilience system
    - Circuit breaker tracking information is available
    - Retry operation metrics are captured
    - Metadata provides actionable operational insights

### test_resilience_health_integration_with_resilience_service_unavailable()

```python
def test_resilience_health_integration_with_resilience_service_unavailable(self, health_checker):
```

Test resilience health monitoring when resilience service is unavailable.

Integration Scope:
    HealthChecker → Failed resilience service integration

Business Impact:
    Ensures health monitoring system remains operational even when
    resilience components fail, providing visibility into system
    degradation without causing monitoring system failures.

Test Strategy:
    - Mock failure of resilience service import/connection
    - Register resilience health check with health checker
    - Execute health check and validate error handling
    - Verify graceful degradation of resilience monitoring

Success Criteria:
    - Health check returns UNHEALTHY status when resilience unavailable
    - Clear error message indicates the nature of the failure
    - Response time is reasonable despite service failure
    - System continues operating without resilience monitoring

### test_resilience_health_integration_with_circuit_breaker_state_transitions()

```python
def test_resilience_health_integration_with_circuit_breaker_state_transitions(self, health_checker):
```

Test resilience health monitoring across different circuit breaker states.

Integration Scope:
    HealthChecker → Resilience orchestrator → State transition monitoring

Business Impact:
    Ensures health monitoring correctly tracks and reports circuit
    breaker state changes, enabling operators to understand system
    resilience behavior over time.

Test Strategy:
    - Mock resilience service with mixed circuit breaker states
    - Register resilience health check with health checker
    - Execute health check and validate state-specific reporting
    - Verify appropriate health status based on breaker states

    Ensures resilience health checks don't become a performance
    bottleneck when monitoring systems scale, maintaining
    operational visibility without impacting system performance.

Test Strategy:
    - Configure resilience service with large metrics dataset
    - Register resilience health check with health checker
    - Execute health check and measure performance
    - Verify response time remains reasonable under load

Success Criteria:
    - Health check completes within performance requirements
