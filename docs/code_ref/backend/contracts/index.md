# Public Contract Stubs

## üéØ Purpose of This Directory

This directory contains "public contract" stub files automatically generated from the production codebase located in `backend/app`.

Each `.pyi` file here represents the public-facing interface of its corresponding source file. It includes:
* All necessary `import` statements.
* Class definitions, including inheritance.
* Public method signatures (including `__init__`) with full type hints.
* The complete docstrings for the module, classes, and all public methods.

Crucially, all internal implementation logic (the code inside method bodies) has been **removed** and replaced with `...`.

The primary purpose of these stubs is to provide a clean, focused, and implementation-agnostic context for AI coding assistants to use when generating tests. This helps enforce our modern, behavior-driven testing philosophy.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Guidelines for AI Coding Assistants

**IMPORTANT:** When tasked with writing or refactoring tests, you **must** use the stub files in this directory as your primary source of context. You should **avoid** referencing the full implementation files in `backend/app` unless explicitly instructed to do so.

**Reasoning:** This practice is critical to our testing strategy. By working exclusively from the public contract, you will generate tests that:

* ‚úÖ Verify **what** the code does (its documented behavior), not **how** it does it.
* ‚úÖ Are resilient to internal refactoring, making our test suite more maintainable.
* ‚úÖ Align with our goal of creating high-quality, less brittle tests that provide true confidence in our code's correctness.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Generating These Files

These files are generated by the `scripts/generate_contract.py` script, which uses Python's `ast` module to parse the source code and extract its public interface.

While this process is typically automated on file save, you can manually regenerate a contract file by running the following command from the project root:

**Command:**
```bash
python scripts/generate_contract.py <input_source_file> -o <output_contract_file>
