# AI Text Processing Frontend Application - Streamlit Starter Template.

  file_path: `frontend/app/app.py`

This module serves as a comprehensive Streamlit frontend application demonstrating best practices
for building production-ready AI applications. It provides a complete web interface for an AI
text processing service and serves as a starter template for developers building similar applications.

# Starter Template Features

This application exemplifies modern Streamlit development patterns and can be used as a foundation
for building AI-powered web applications with the following characteristics:

## Core Application Capabilities
- **Text summarization** with configurable length parameters
- **Sentiment analysis** with confidence scoring and explanations
- **Key point extraction** with customizable count settings
- **Question generation** for educational and content creation purposes
- **Question & Answer** functionality for interactive text exploration

## Production-Ready Features
- **Real-time API health monitoring** with status indicators
- **Dynamic operation configuration** based on backend capabilities
- **Intelligent example text system** with operation-specific recommendations
- **Multi-modal input support** (text entry, file upload) with validation
- **Results persistence** with download functionality and session management
- **Responsive design** with progress indicators and user feedback
- **Comprehensive error handling** with graceful degradation

## Architecture Patterns Demonstrated

### Frontend Architecture
- **Modular component design** with single-responsibility functions
- **Separation of concerns** between UI, logic, and data layers
- **Configuration-driven behavior** with environment-specific settings
- **Shared data models** for type safety and API consistency

### User Experience Patterns
- **Progressive disclosure** with collapsible sections and smart defaults
- **Contextual assistance** through operation-specific recommendations
- **Immediate feedback** with real-time validation and status updates
- **Accessibility considerations** with semantic markup and help text

### Integration Patterns
- **Async API communication** with proper error handling and timeouts
- **Dynamic UI generation** based on backend capabilities
- **Session state management** for stateful user interactions
- **File handling** with validation, preview, and encoding support

## Template Customization Guide

### For AI Applications
1. **Replace AI operations**: Modify the text processing operations to match your AI service
2. **Update models**: Replace shared models with your domain-specific data structures
3. **Customize UI**: Adapt the interface components to your application's needs
4. **Configure examples**: Update sample data to reflect your use cases

### For General Applications
1. **API integration**: Replace the API client with your backend communication layer
2. **Data processing**: Modify input/output handling for your data types
3. **UI components**: Adapt the layout and controls to your application requirements
4. **Configuration**: Update settings and environment variables for your deployment

## Quick Start for Developers

```python
# Basic application structure
def main():
display_header()                    # Application branding
check_api_health()                 # Backend connectivity
operation, options = select_operation_sidebar()  # Dynamic configuration
examples_sidebar()                 # Contextual examples

# Main interaction flow
text_content, question = display_text_input()
if st.button("Process"):
request = create_processing_request(text_content, operation, options)
response = run_async(api_client.process_text(request))
handle_processing_result(response, operation)

# Results display
display_results(response, operation)
```

## Deployment Examples

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run with auto-reload
streamlit run app.py --server.runOnSave=true
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up frontend

# Or standalone container
docker build -t my-ai-app .
docker run -p 8501:8501 my-ai-app
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# With environment configuration
export API_BASE_URL="https://api.myapp.com"
export STREAMLIT_ENV="production"
streamlit run app.py --server.port=8501 --server.address=0.0.0.0
```

## Dependencies and Extensions

### Core Dependencies
- **streamlit**: Modern web application framework for Python
- **httpx**: Async HTTP client for API communication
- **pydantic**: Data validation and settings management

### Custom Modules
- **shared.models**: Type-safe data models shared with backend
- **shared.sample_data**: Curated example content for demonstrations
- **utils.api_client**: Robust API communication with error handling
- **config**: Environment-aware configuration management
