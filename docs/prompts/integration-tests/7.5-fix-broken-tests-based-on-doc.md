We're implementing fixes to the `text_processor` integration test suite at `backend/tests/integration/text_processor/*.py` following guidance from `backend/tests/integration/text_processor/TEST_FIXES.md`. Create a plan to implement each task in `## Implementation Recommendations` on lines 740-802 using SEQUENTIAL general-purpose subagents. Ask each agent to assure that all files they modify files pass linting by running the `/fix-lint-errors [file.py]` custom slash command. If any subagent is unable to make a test pass due to newly discovered issues after multiple tries, ask them to document the issue in a detailed `pytest.mark.skip(reason=)` message for future review by the user.
