# Integration Testing

## Prompt 4: Review and Validate Integration Test Plan (OPTIONAL Quality Gate)

**Purpose**: Independent validation of the integration test plan by a different (typically more capable) LLM before implementation begins.

**Context**: This optional step provides a quality gate between planning (Prompts 1-3) and implementation (Prompt 5). It's most valuable when:
- Using fast/cheap models for Prompts 1-3
- Working on complex/critical components
- Uncertain about prioritization decisions
- New to integration testing philosophy

**Economic Rationale**: Pay for quality only at decision points. Use cheap models for analysis (Prompts 1-3), expensive model for validation (Prompt 4), cheap model for
implementation (Prompt 5).

**When to Skip**: Simple components, confident in Prompt 3 output, or already used expensive model for Prompts 1-3.

## Input Requirements

**Required Files**:
1. **Test Plan** (Prompt 3 output): Usually named `TEST_PLAN.md` or `INTEGRATION_TEST_PLAN.md`
    - Consolidated seams from Prompts 1 and 2
    - Prioritized as P0/P1/P2/Deferred
    - Validation checkboxes should be completed

2. **Testing Philosophy Documentation**:
    - `docs/guides/testing/INTEGRATION_TESTS.md` - Integration testing philosophy
    - `docs/guides/testing/WRITING_TESTS.md` - Docstring-driven test development

**Optional Context** (if available):
- Original Prompt 1 output (architectural analysis)
- Original Prompt 2 output (unit test mining)
- Public interface/contract (`.pyi` file or docstrings)
- Existing integration test READMEs for reference

---

## Review Process

### Step 1: Understand Testing Philosophy (5 minutes)

Read the following and summarize key principles:

1. **Review `docs/guides/testing/INTEGRATION_TESTS.md`**:
    - What is our definition of integration testing?
    - What are the 3 most important principles?
    - What are the 3 most important anti-patterns?

2. **Review `docs/guides/testing/WRITING_TESTS.md`**:
    - What is docstring-driven test development?
    - How should tests relate to documented behavior?
    - What should NOT be tested?

**Output**: Brief summary showing you understand our testing philosophy.

### Step 2: Validate Test Plan Structure (10 minutes)

**Check the test plan has required sections**:

- [ ] Consolidation Summary (Prompt 1 + 2 seams identified)
- [ ] P0 - Must Have (Critical path tests)
- [ ] P1 - Should Have (Important integrations)
- [ ] P2 - Could Have (Nice to have)
- [ ] Deferred/Eliminated (What was excluded and why)

**Validate each seam entry has**:
- [ ] SOURCE marker (CONFIRMED, NEW, Prompt 1 only)
- [ ] COMPONENTS list (real components involved)
- [ ] SCENARIOS (concrete test scenarios)
- [ ] BUSINESS VALUE (why this matters)
- [ ] INTEGRATION RISK (what could go wrong)
- [ ] IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (fixtures, complexity, test count)
- [ ] VALIDATION checkboxes (all checked ‚úÖ)

**Flag if missing**: Any required section or incomplete seam documentation.

### Step 3: Critical Review - Integration vs. Unit Tests (15 minutes)

**For each P0/P1 seam, verify it's truly an integration test**:

**‚úÖ PASS - This is an integration test if**:
- [ ] Tests multiple real components working together
- [ ] Uses high-fidelity infrastructure (fakeredis, testcontainers)
- [ ] Verifies behavior unit tests CANNOT verify
- [ ] Has clear business value beyond unit test coverage
- [ ] Focuses on seams/boundaries, not component internals

**‚ùå FAIL - This is a unit test disguised as integration if**:
- [ ] Mocks most dependencies and verifies method calls
- [ ] Only exercises single component with mocked collaborators
- [ ] Duplicates existing unit test coverage
- [ ] Tests implementation details, not integration behavior
- [ ] Could be verified by unit tests alone

**Actionable Feedback**:
- For FAILs: "This should be a unit test because..."
- For borderline: "Consider whether this provides value beyond unit test X"
- For PASSes: Confirm integration value

### Step 4: Validate Prioritization (10 minutes)

**Check P0 (Must Have) tests are truly critical**:

Review the prioritization matrix from Prompt 3:
| Source | Business Impact | Integration Risk | Priority |
|--------|----------------|------------------|----------|
| CONFIRMED (Prompt 1 + 2) | HIGH | HIGH | P0 |

**For each P0 seam, verify**:
- [ ] Both Prompt 1 AND Prompt 2 identified it (CONFIRMED)
- [ ] Business impact is genuinely HIGH (user-facing, costs, security)
- [ ] Integration risk is genuinely HIGH (failure modes are realistic)
- [ ] Failure would impact critical path or business operations

**Challenge questionable P0s**:
- "Seam X is marked P0 but only identified in Prompt 1 - should this be P1?"
- "Business value claims 'improves performance' but no performance requirement exists - is this P1?"
- "Integration risk is 'Redis might fail' but we have graceful degradation - reconsider priority?"

**Check P1/P2 aren't actually P0**:
- Security-critical integration in P1? Should be P0
- User-facing feature in P2? Should be P0 or P1

### Step 5: Review for Missing Seams (10 minutes)

**Based on testing philosophy, check for common gaps**:

**Resilience Patterns** (often missing):
- [ ] What happens when cache fails?
- [ ] What happens when database is unavailable?
- [ ] What happens when external API is slow/down?
- [ ] Are there circuit breakers that need integration testing?

**Security Boundaries** (critical):
- [ ] Are authentication seams tested?
- [ ] Is authorization enforcement tested?
- [ ] Are encryption workflows tested end-to-end?
- [ ] Are TLS/certificate integrations validated?

**Performance-Critical Paths** (business impact):
- [ ] Is caching performance improvement verified?
- [ ] Are batch operations tested for performance?
- [ ] Are concurrent access patterns validated?

**Actionable Feedback**:
- "Consider adding: Service ‚Üí Cache failure resilience test (P1)"
- "Security gap: Authentication ‚Üí Authorization integration not tested (P0)"

### Step 6: Review Deferred/Eliminated Tests (5 minutes)

**Validate deferral reasons are sound**:

**Good reasons to defer**:
- ‚úÖ Better suited for E2E tests (requires real external API)
- ‚úÖ Adequately covered by unit tests (no integration value)
- ‚úÖ Low business value (admin feature, rare use case)
- ‚úÖ Requires expensive resources (real AI API with costs)

**Bad reasons to defer (should reconsider)**:
- ‚ùå "Too complex to test" (may indicate critical integration risk)
- ‚ùå "Don't know how to test" (may need better approach)
- ‚ùå "Takes too long to run" (may need better infrastructure)

**Actionable Feedback**:
- "Test X deferred as 'too complex' but it's security-critical - reconsider as P1 with simplified approach"
- "Test Y deferred to E2E but doesn't need real API - could use mock, add as P1"

### Step 7: Validate Test Count and Scope (5 minutes)

**Check if test plan is realistic**:

**Integration test suites should be small and dense**:
- P0 tests: Typically 3-7 test files (critical path only)
- P1 tests: Typically 3-10 test files (important integrations)
- P2 tests: Typically 0-5 test files (nice to have)

**Red flags**:
- ‚ùå More than 15 P0 tests (likely including non-critical tests)
- ‚ùå More than 30 total integration tests (too comprehensive, not selective)
- ‚ùå Tests that span too many components (likely E2E, not integration)
- ‚ùå Tests with minimal business value in P0 (wrong priority)

**Actionable Feedback**:
- "20 P0 tests is too many - integration tests should be selective. Recommend moving tests X, Y, Z to P1/P2"
- "Test covers API ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Cache ‚Üí Database ‚Üí External API - this is E2E, not integration"

Success Criteria

Review is complete when:

1. Philosophy Understanding: Demonstrates clear understanding of our integration testing principles
2. Structural Validation: Confirms test plan has all required sections
3. Integration Verification: Validates tests are truly integration (not unit tests)
4. Priority Validation: Confirms P0 tests are genuinely critical path
5. Gap Analysis: Identifies missing seams (resilience, security, performance)
6. Honest Assessment: Provides actionable feedback, not rubber stamp approval
7. Clear Recommendation: Explicit APPROVE/REVISE decision with reasoning

The review should provide specific, actionable feedback that improves test plan quality before implementation begins.
