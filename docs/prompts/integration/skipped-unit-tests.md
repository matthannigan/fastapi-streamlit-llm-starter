Closely examine the following skipped unit tests and compare to the integration testing documentation at `backend/tests/integration/startup/README.md` and the test files themselves at `backend/tests/integration/startup/test_*.py`.

```

```
Categorize the tests into the following categories:
- Tests that are essentially duplicative of existing integration tests
- Tests that are not covered by the integration testing and should be implemented as new integration tests
