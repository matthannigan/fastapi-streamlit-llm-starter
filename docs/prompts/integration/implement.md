Use as many as 3 parallel @agent-integration-test-implementer sub-agents to implement all integration tests for the component defined by the public contract at `backend/contracts/infrastructure/monitoring/health.pyi` following our integration testing philosophy as documented in `docs/guides/testing/INTEGRATION_TESTS.md` and the test plan as documented in `backend/tests/integration/startup/TEST_PLAN.md`.

**Priority-Based Implementation Order:**

1. **HIGHEST PRIORITY** (Security critical and foundational):
   - Encryption Pipeline End-to-End Integration (Seam 1)
   - Environment Configuration and Key Management Integration (Seam 2)
   - Error Handling and Exception Propagation Integration (Seam 4)
   - Cryptography Library Dependency and Graceful Degradation Integration (Seam 7)
   - Cache Factory Integration with Encryption (Seam 8)

2. **HIGH PRIORITY** (Complete system validation):
   - End-to-End Encrypted Cache Workflows (Seam 9)
