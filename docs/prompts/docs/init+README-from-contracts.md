Thoroughly review the public contracts for the core environment detection service in `backend/contracts/core/environment/*.pyi`. Then identify and implementant revisions or improvements to the documentation in the `backend/app/core/environment/__init__.py` module docstring and `docs/guides/developer/ENVIRONMENT_DETECTION.md`. Finally, using `backend/app/core/middleware/README.md` as a template, create a new core environment detection service README at `backend/app/core/environment/README.md`.
