We're working on the unit tests for our `backend/app/infrastructure/security/auth.py` component as defined by the public contract at `backend/contracts/infrastructure/security/auth.pyi`. The tests are located in `backend/tests/infrastructure/security/auth/*.py`. Please investigate the skip, error, and/or failure messages below that were created during the unit test implementation. Propose test updates, fixture updates, or changes to production code to better fulfill the public contract. Do not make any file edits yet. Present your findings and recommendations for discussion.

```
SKIPPED [1] backend/tests/infrastructure/security/test_api_key_auth.py:788: Current implementation doesn't clean up metadata during reload_keys - metadata persists even after keys are removed
SKIPPED [1] backend/tests/infrastructure/security/test_api_key_auth.py:957: Current implementation doesn't handle environment detection failures gracefully
SKIPPED [1] backend/tests/infrastructure/security/test_api_key_auth.py:811: Current implementation doesn't maintain consistency between api_keys and metadata during reload_keys
SKIPPED [1] backend/tests/infrastructure/security/test_api_key_auth.py:766: Current implementation doesn't clean up metadata during reload_keys - only adds new keys without removing old metadata
``` 

Are there any class or method docstring updates required after your production code changes or is the public contract unchanged?
