We're working on the unit tests for our `backend/app/infrastructure/monitoring/health.py` component as defined by the public contract at `backend/contracts/infrastructure/monitoring/health.pyi`. The tests are located in `backend/tests/unit/health/test_health.py`. Please investigate the skip, error, and/or failure messages below that were created during the unit test implementation. Propose test updates, fixture updates, or changes to production code to better fulfill the public contract. Do not make any file edits yet. Present your findings and recommendations for discussion.

```
FAILED tests/unit/health/test_health.py::TestBuiltInHealthChecks::test_check_cache_health_with_healthy_cache - assert <HealthStatus.UNHEALTHY: 'unhealthy'> == <HealthStatus.HEALTHY: 'healthy'>
``` 

Are there any class or method docstring updates required after your production code changes or is the public contract unchanged?
