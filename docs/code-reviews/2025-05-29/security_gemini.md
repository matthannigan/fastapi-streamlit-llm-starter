### 1. Vulnerability Identification & Prioritization

Here, potential security vulnerabilities are identified, categorized (referencing OWASP Top 10 where applicable), and prioritized.

---

**A2:2021 – Cryptographic Failures (Formerly Sensitive Data Exposure)**

* **Issue:** Use of MD5 for cache key generation.
    * **Description:** The `backend/app/services/cache.py` file uses `hashlib.md5` to generate cache keys. MD5 is a cryptographically broken hash function susceptible to collisions. While the primary purpose here is key generation and not secure hashing for sensitive data, using a weak algorithm can still lead to unintended cache behavior if collisions occur, or if there's a misunderstanding of its security properties.
    * **Potential Impact:** Cache collisions could lead to users receiving incorrect cached data. If the input to the hash function is guessable, it might be possible to deliberately cause cache collisions or retrieve cached information not intended for the attacker.
    * **Code Snippet (`backend/app/services/cache.py`):**
        ```python
        def _generate_cache_key(self, text: str, operation: str, options: Dict[str, Any], question: str = None) -> str:
            """Generate consistent cache key for request."""
            cache_data = {
                "text": text,
                "operation": operation,
                "options": sorted(options.items()) if options else [],
                "question": question
            }
            content = json.dumps(cache_data, sort_keys=True)
            return f"ai_cache:{hashlib.md5(content.encode()).hexdigest()}" # [ চিন্তা করা দরকার ]
        ```
    * **Remediation:** Replace MD5 with a stronger, non-cryptographic hash function if the goal is unique key generation without security implications (e.g., `xxhash`), or use a secure hash function like SHA-256 if cryptographic properties are desired for any reason. Given it's for a cache key, a fast, non-cryptographic hash function with good distribution is often preferred.
        ```python
        # Example with SHA-256 (if cryptographic properties are needed for some reason)
        # import hashlib
        # return f"ai_cache:{hashlib.sha256(content.encode()).hexdigest()}"

        # Example with a fast non-cryptographic hash (e.g., xxhash, install with pip install xxhash)
        # import xxhash
        # return f"ai_cache:{xxhash.xxh64(content.encode()).hexdigest()}"
        ```
    * **Severity:** Low (primarily a robustness/cache integrity issue rather than direct data exposure in this context, but use of broken crypto is a bad practice).

---

**A5:2021 – Security Misconfiguration**

* **Issue:** Potentially overly permissive CORS configuration in development.
    * **Description:** The `backend/app/main.py` allows all methods (`allow_methods=["*"]`) and all headers (`allow_headers=["*"]`) for CORS. While `allowed_origins` is configured via `settings.allowed_origins`, using wildcards for methods and headers can be more permissive than necessary.
    * **Potential Impact:** If `allowed_origins` were ever misconfigured to be too permissive (e.g., containing a wildcard or unintended domains), the wildcard for methods and headers would exacerbate the risk, potentially allowing unintended cross-origin requests.
    * **Code Snippet (`backend/app/main.py`):**
        ```python
        app.add_middleware(
            CORSMiddleware,  # type: ignore[arg-type]
            allow_origins=settings.allowed_origins,  # type: ignore[call-arg]
            allow_credentials=True,  # type: ignore[call-arg]
            allow_methods=["*"],  # type: ignore[call-arg] # [ চিন্তা করা দরকার ]
            allow_headers=["*"],  # type: ignore[call-arg] # [ চিন্তা করা দরকার ]
        )
        ```
    * **Remediation:** Specify the exact HTTP methods (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `OPTIONS`) and headers that the frontend application needs to use.
    * **Severity:** Low (as `allowed_origins` is the primary control here, but it's a defense-in-depth improvement).

* **Issue:** Debug mode potentially enabled in production via environment variable.
    * **Description:** The `backend/app/config.py` (`DEBUG=false`) and `docker-compose.prod.yml` (`DEBUG=false`) set debug mode to false for production. However, `docker-compose.yml` (which might be used as a base or in non-prod-flagged deployments) sets `DEBUG=${DEBUG:-true}`. If the `.env` file or environment doesn't explicitly set `DEBUG=false`, it could default to true. Similar behavior in `frontend/app/config.py` and `docker-compose.dev.yml`. Running in debug mode in production can leak sensitive information through detailed error pages.
    * **Potential Impact:** Exposure of sensitive debugging information, internal application paths, configuration details, or stack traces if an error occurs in a production environment.
    * **File Paths:**
        * `backend/app/config.py`
        * `frontend/app/config.py`
        * `docker-compose.yml`
        * `docker-compose.dev.yml`
        * `docker-compose.prod.yml`
    * **Remediation:** Ensure that production deployment scripts or environment configurations strictly set `DEBUG=false`. Avoid default fallbacks to `true` in any production-related compose files. Production Dockerfiles should not install development dependencies.
    * **Severity:** Medium (if debug mode is active in production).

* **Issue:** Nginx `server_name` is `localhost`.
    * **Description:** In `nginx/nginx.conf`, the `server_name` is set to `localhost`. For a production deployment, this should be the actual domain name(s) the server is intended to respond to.
    * **Potential Impact:** Nginx might not respond correctly to requests for the intended domain, or it might respond to requests where the Host header is `localhost`, which could be a misconfiguration if other vhosts are present.
    * **Code Snippet (`nginx/nginx.conf`):**
        ```nginx
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name localhost; # [ চিন্তা করা দরকার ]
        ```
    * **Remediation:** Change `server_name localhost;` to `server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;` or as appropriate for the deployment.
    * **Severity:** Low to Medium (depending on the deployment context and other Nginx configurations).

* **Issue:** Default `GEMINI_API_KEY` in CI.
    * **Description:** The GitHub Actions workflow `test.yml` hardcodes `GEMINI_API_KEY: test-key` for backend tests. While this is a test key, it's a good practice to use secrets for any API key, even in CI, to avoid accidental exposure or if the test environment interacts with a shared staging backend.
    * **Potential Impact:** If the `test-key` had any real, albeit limited, privileges or quota, this could be abused. It also sets a precedent for handling keys.
    * **Code Snippet (`.github/workflows/test.yml`):**
        ```yaml
        - name: Run backend tests
          env:
            GEMINI_API_KEY: test-key # [ চিন্তা করা দরকার ]
        ```
    * **Remediation:** Store the `test-key` as a GitHub secret and reference it in the workflow: `GEMINI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_TEST_API_KEY }}`.
    * **Severity:** Low.

**A7:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures (Formerly Broken Authentication)**

* **Issue:** API Key management relies on environment variables and potentially hardcoded test keys.
    * **Description:** Authentication is primarily API key-based, loaded from environment variables (`API_KEY`, `ADDITIONAL_API_KEYS`) as seen in `backend/app/auth.py` and configured via `.env.example`. The `scripts/generate_api_key.py` produces secure random tokens. However, `backend/tests/test_manual_api.py` and `backend/tests/test_manual_auth.py` use a hardcoded `TEST_API_KEY = "test-api-key-12345"`. The main concern here is the proper protection of the `.env` file in production and ensuring test keys are not inadvertently used or discoverable in production.
    * **Potential Impact:** If the `.env` file containing production API keys is compromised (e.g., committed to the repository, exposed via server misconfiguration), it would lead to unauthorized API access. Use of easily guessable or static test keys in staging/dev if they connect to shared resources could also be a risk.
    * **File Paths:**
        * `backend/app/auth.py`
        * `.env.example`
        * `backend/tests/test_manual_api.py`
        * `backend/tests/test_manual_auth.py`
    * **Remediation:**
        * Strictly ensure `.env` files are never committed to version control (already good practice with `.gitignore`).
        * Use a proper secrets management solution for production environments (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) instead of relying solely on environment variables passed to containers if feasible.
        * Avoid hardcoding test API keys directly in test files if these tests might run against shared non-production environments; prefer loading them from test-specific environment configurations.
    * **Severity:** Medium (risk depends heavily on operational security of `.env` files).

* **Issue:** Development mode allows unauthenticated access if no API keys are configured.
    * **Description:** `backend/app/auth.py` in `verify_api_key` explicitly allows access and returns "development" as the key if `api_key_auth.api_keys` is empty. This is also mentioned in `get_auth_status` and `is_development_mode`.
    * **Potential Impact:** If a production system is accidentally deployed without any API keys configured (e.g., `.env` file missing or `API_KEY` variable not set), the API could become fully unprotected.
    * **Code Snippet (`backend/app/auth.py`):**
        ```python
        # If no API keys are configured, allow access (development mode)
        if not api_key_auth.api_keys:
            logger.warning("No API keys configured - allowing unauthenticated access")
            return "development"
        ```
    * **Remediation:**
        * Implement a stricter check for production environments. For example, if `DEBUG` is false, an error should be raised at startup if no API keys are configured.
        * Alternatively, remove the "development" mode bypass entirely and always require a key, even for local development, to maintain consistency.
    * **Severity:** High (if accidentally triggered in production).

---

**A8:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures**

* **Issue:** Lack of integrity checks for dependencies.
    * **Description:** The `requirements.txt` files list dependencies, often with minimum versions or ranges (e.g., `fastapi>=0.110.0`, `httpx>=0.25.0,<0.26.0`). There's no use of hash-checking (like in `pip freeze > requirements.txt --require-hashes`) or a lock file mechanism like `poetry.lock` or `Pipfile.lock` consistently across the monorepo.
    * **Potential Impact:** Without integrity checks or pinned dependencies, there's a risk of installing compromised or unexpectedly changed packages during build or deployment if a dependency source is compromised or a different version matching the range has issues.
    * **File Paths:**
        * `backend/requirements.txt`
        * `frontend/requirements.txt`
        * `examples/requirements.txt`
    * **Remediation:**
        * Use a dependency management tool like Poetry or PDM that generates lock files with hashes (`poetry.lock`, `pdm.lock`).
        * Alternatively, generate `requirements.txt` with specific versions (e.g., `pip freeze > requirements.txt`) and consider using `--require-hashes`.
        * Ensure consistent dependency versions across different projects in the monorepo.
    * **Severity:** Medium.

---

**Insufficient Logging & Monitoring (OWASP Top 10 A09:2021)**

* **Issue:** Limited centralized security logging details.
    * **Description:** While logging is implemented (e.g., `logger.info`, `logger.warning`, `logger.error` in various files), there isn't a clear strategy outlined for centralized security logging or specific formats that would aid in rapid security incident analysis. For instance, `verify_api_key` logs an invalid key attempt but could include more contextual information (e.g., source IP if available through the request object, endpoint accessed).
    * **Potential Impact:** Difficulty in detecting and responding to security incidents, reconstructing attack timelines, or identifying anomalous behavior.
    * **File Paths:**
        * `backend/app/main.py` (global exception handler)
        * `backend/app/auth.py` (API key verification)
        * `backend/app/services/text_processor.py` (processing errors)
    * **Remediation:**
        * Establish a consistent structured logging format (e.g., JSON) that includes timestamps, severity, source module, correlation IDs, and relevant security event details (e.g., user/key ID, source IP, action attempted, outcome).
        * Log all authentication successes and failures with sufficient detail.
        * Log authorization failures.
        * Ensure logs are shipped to a central, secure logging system for analysis and alerting.
        * Be cautious not to log overly sensitive data like full API keys or raw request bodies if they contain PII.
    * **Severity:** Medium.

---

### 2. Common Security Anti-Patterns

* **Hardcoded Secrets:**
    * **Issue:** Test API keys and a test Gemini API key are hardcoded.
        * `backend/tests/test_manual_api.py`: `TEST_API_KEY = "test-api-key-12345"`
        * `backend/tests/test_manual_auth.py`: `TEST_API_KEY = "test-api-key-12345"`
        * `.github/workflows/test.yml`: `GEMINI_API_KEY: test-key`
    * **Suggestion:** For CI, use GitHub secrets. For manual tests, if they are run against non-local environments, consider loading these from environment variables or a local test-specific `.env` file not committed to the repository. The `.env.example` correctly shows the pattern for providing keys via environment, which is good.
    * **Severity:** Low (as they are test keys), but an anti-pattern.

* **Use of Weak or Outdated Cryptographic Algorithms:**
    * **Issue:** `hashlib.md5` used in `backend/app/services/cache.py` for cache key generation.
    * **Suggestion:** As mentioned in A2:2021, replace with a more robust hashing algorithm. SHA-256 is a common secure alternative, or for non-cryptographic use cases like cache keys, `xxhash` provides good performance and collision resistance.
    * **Severity:** Low (in this specific context).

* **Lack of Rate Limiting or Brute-Force Protection on Sensitive Endpoints (Backend):**
    * **Issue:** While Nginx (`nginx/nginx.conf`) implements rate limiting (`limit_req_zone`), the backend FastAPI application itself does not appear to have explicit rate limiting or brute-force protection on authentication or sensitive processing endpoints. Relying solely on a reverse proxy might not be sufficient if the backend is exposed directly or if more granular application-level rate limiting is needed (e.g., per API key). The `AIServiceResilience` module focuses on outgoing AI service calls, not incoming request rate limiting.
    * **Suggestion:**
        * Implement rate limiting at the FastAPI application level, potentially on a per-API-key basis for protected endpoints. Libraries like `slowapi` can be used.
        * Implement account lockout or temporary API key suspension mechanisms after repeated failed authentication attempts (though this is more complex with API keys vs. user accounts).
    * **Severity:** Medium.

* **Missing or Improperly Configured Security Headers:**
    * **Issue:** `nginx/nginx.conf` includes some good security headers: `X-Frame-Options DENY;`, `X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;`, `X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";`.
    * **Suggestion:** This is good. Consider adding:
        * `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)`: To prevent XSS and data injection attacks. This would be more critical for the frontend if it served dynamic HTML content beyond what Streamlit provides by default.
        * `Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)`: To enforce HTTPS. (Requires SSL/TLS to be configured and committed to).
        * `Referrer-Policy`: To control referrer information.
        * `Permissions-Policy` (formerly `Feature-Policy`): To control browser features.
    * **Severity:** Low (as some essential headers are present).

* **Generation of Predictable Tokens or Identifiers:**
    * **Issue:** API keys are generated using `secrets.token_hex()` in `scripts/generate_api_key.py`.
        ```python
        random_part = secrets.token_hex(length)
        ```
    * **Suggestion:** This is a good practice. `secrets.token_hex()` is suitable for generating cryptographically strong tokens. Ensure the `length` parameter (default 32 bytes, resulting in a 64-character hex string) is sufficient.
    * **Severity:** Not an issue (good practice identified).

---

### 3. Input Validation & Output Encoding

* **User-Supplied Input Validation:**
    * **Backend:** Pydantic models are used extensively in `shared/models.py` (e.g., `TextProcessingRequest`, `APIKeyValidation`) and applied in FastAPI endpoints in `backend/app/main.py`. These models provide input validation (e.g., `min_length`, `max_length`, custom `field_validator`s). This is a good practice.
        * `TextProcessingRequest` validates text length and ensures `question` is present for Q&A.
        * `APIKeyValidation` has a basic regex for API key format.
    * **Frontend:** `frontend/app/app.py` uses `st.text_area` with `max_chars` and handles file uploads. The primary validation seems to rely on backend Pydantic models.
    * **Consistency:** The use of shared Pydantic models promotes consistency in validation between what the frontend might expect and what the backend enforces.

* **Output Encoding & Sanitization:**
    * **Backend:** FastAPI automatically handles JSON encoding for responses, which is generally safe for API contexts.
    * **Frontend (`frontend/app/app.py`):** Streamlit's built-in functions like `st.write`, `st.markdown`, `st.success`, `st.error`, `st.json` are used. Streamlit generally handles HTML escaping for its output widgets to prevent XSS. However, if `st.markdown` is used with `unsafe_allow_html=True` (not seen in the provided code), it would be a risk. Current usage appears safe.
        * Results from the API are displayed (e.g., `st.write(response.result)`). Assuming these results are plain text or pre-formatted by the AI in a safe manner, this is acceptable. If AI could return HTML/Markdown that needs to be rendered, care would be needed.

* **File Uploads (`frontend/app/app.py`):**
    * **Type:** `type=['txt', 'md']` restricts file types, which is good.
    * **Size:** No explicit size limit is immediately visible in the Streamlit file uploader call itself, but `settings.max_text_length` (default 10000 characters) is used for text areas and presumably should apply to file content as well. The backend `TextProcessingRequest` Pydantic model also has `max_length=10000` for the text field. This implies a content size check rather than a raw file size check.
    * **Content:** The content is read as UTF-8 string: `text_content = str(uploaded_file.read(), "utf-8")`. This is then passed to the backend. No specific content sanitization (e.g., for control characters beyond UTF-8 validation) is apparent before sending to the backend, but the primary risk would be how the backend processes this text with the AI.
    * **Suggestion:** While Pydantic validates text length, consider an explicit file size limit in the frontend or Nginx to prevent very large file uploads consuming resources before Pydantic validation kicks in on the content.

---

### 4. Authentication & Authorization

* **Authentication Mechanisms (`backend/app/auth.py`):**
    * Primary mechanism is API Key authentication (Bearer token).
    * Keys are loaded from `settings.api_key` and `settings.additional_api_keys` (environment variables). This is a common practice.
    * `verify_api_key` checks if the provided key is in the loaded set.
    * **Development Mode Weakness:** As noted earlier, if no API keys are configured, authentication is bypassed. This is risky if accidentally deployed to production.
    * **Test Key:** A hardcoded `test-api-key-12345` is accepted during Pytest runs. This is acceptable for testing but ensure it has no real privileges if tests run against shared environments.
    * **Password Policies:** Not applicable as it's API key-based.
    * **Session Management:** Appears to be stateless (token-based), which is appropriate for an API.

* **Authorization Logic:**
    * **Current State:** Authorization seems to be based solely on the validity of the API key. If a key is valid, access is granted to the endpoint. There's no evidence of role-based access control (RBAC) or permission checks beyond authentication itself.
    * **`AuthConfig` hints:** The `AuthConfig` class has properties like `supports_user_context` and `supports_permissions`, and `APIKeyAuth` has `_key_metadata` which could store permissions. However, the `simple_mode` is true by default, and these advanced features do not appear to be implemented or enforced in the current endpoint definitions (`verify_api_key` is used, not `verify_api_key_with_metadata` which might leverage this).
    * **Endpoint Protection:**
        * `/process`, `/batch_process`, `/auth/status`, and most `/resilience/*` endpoints (except `/resilience/health` and `/resilience/dashboard` which use `optional_verify_api_key`) require a valid API key via `Depends(verify_api_key)`.
        * `/health`, `/operations`, `/cache/status`, `/cache/invalidate`, `/resilience/health`, `/resilience/dashboard` are either public or use `optional_verify_api_key`.
    * **Potential Risks:**
        * **Privilege Escalation:** Not a significant risk with the current simple model, as all valid keys grant the same level of access. If more granular permissions were intended but not correctly enforced, this could be an issue.
        * **Unauthorized Data Access:** If different API keys were intended to have access to different data subsets (not evident here), the current model wouldn't support it.
    * **Monorepo Context:** Shared components (`shared/models.py`) are used, but authorization is centralized in `backend/app/auth.py` and applied at the endpoint level in `backend/app/main.py` and `backend/app/resilience_endpoints.py`.

---

### 5. Error Handling & Information Disclosure

* **Error Handling Practices:**
    * **Backend (`backend/app/main.py`):**
        * A `global_exception_handler` is defined, which catches unhandled `Exception` types and returns a generic 500 error with `ErrorResponse`. This prevents stack trace leakage to the client for unhandled exceptions.
            ```python
            @app.exception_handler(Exception)
            async def global_exception_handler(request, exc):
                logger.error(f"Unhandled exception: {str(exc)}")
                return JSONResponse(
                    status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
                    content=ErrorResponse(
                        error="Internal server error",
                        error_code="INTERNAL_ERROR"
                    ).dict()
                )
            ```
        * Specific `HTTPException`s are raised for known error conditions (e.g., validation errors, auth failures, Q&A missing question), providing appropriate status codes and detail messages. This is good.
        * Logging is present for errors (e.g., `logger.error`, `logger.warning`).
    * **Frontend (`frontend/app/utils/api_client.py`):**
        * The `APIClient` catches `httpx.TimeoutException`, `httpx.HTTPStatusError`, and general `Exception`.
        * It uses `st.error()` to display error messages to the user. The messages are generally user-friendly (e.g., "Request timed out. Please try again.", "API Error: {error_msg}").
        * It logs errors using `logger.error()`.

* **Information Disclosure:**
    * The global exception handler in the backend prevents leakage of stack traces or sensitive debug information for unhandled errors.
    * FastAPI's default behavior for `HTTPException` also avoids leaking excessive detail.
    * Pydantic validation errors (422) will return structured information about which fields failed validation, which is standard and helpful for API clients.
    * Debug mode (`DEBUG=true`) is a potential source of information disclosure if enabled in production, as discussed in "Security Misconfiguration."
    * The `/resilience/config` endpoint exposes detailed resilience configurations, including retry counts, timeouts, and strategy names. While useful for debugging, this might be more information than desired for an unauthenticated or broadly accessible endpoint if these details are considered sensitive. However, it currently requires authentication via `verify_api_key`.
    * The `/resilience/dashboard` and `/resilience/health` endpoints, using `optional_verify_api_key`, might expose some internal state (like open circuit breakers or monitored operations) to unauthenticated users if no API key is provided. This should be reviewed based on sensitivity.

* **Graceful Handling:**
    * The application appears to handle errors gracefully without crashing, returning appropriate HTTP error codes and JSON error responses from the backend.
    * The frontend displays error messages using Streamlit's error components.
    * The `AIServiceResilience` module (`backend/app/services/resilience.py`) is designed to handle failures in AI service calls gracefully with retries and circuit breakers, including providing fallback responses. This is a strong point.

---

### 6. Dependency Security Management (Monorepo Context)

* **Management of Third-Party Dependencies:**
    * Dependencies are managed via `requirements.txt` files in `backend/`, `frontend/`, and `examples/`.
    * `requirements-dev.txt` files are used for development dependencies in `backend/` and `frontend/`.
* **Outdated Libraries/CVEs:**
    * **Limitation:** The `requirements.txt` files mostly use minimum versions (e.g., `fastapi>=0.110.0`) or ranges (e.g., `httpx>=0.25.0,<0.26.0`). Without exact, pinned versions (like from a lock file), it's impossible to perform an accurate CVE scan based on this static export.
    * **Example:** `frontend/requirements.txt` specifies `streamlit>=1.28.1,<1.29.0`. `backend/requirements.txt` specifies `fastapi>=0.110.0`. These allow updates within a range.
    * **General Observation:** Some dependencies have quite broad ranges (e.g., `pydantic>=2.10` in backend).
* **Mechanisms for Consistent and Secure Versions:**
    * There is no explicit mechanism visible in the export (like a monorepo-wide lock file from tools like Poetry or Bazel, or a central `constraints.txt`) to ensure consistent versions of shared dependencies across `backend` and `frontend` if they were to share more direct dependencies beyond Pydantic models. Currently, their `requirements.txt` are managed separately.
    * **Suggestion:**
        * Use a dependency management tool that generates lock files (e.g., `poetry lock`, `pdm lock`) for each project (`backend`, `frontend`) to ensure reproducible builds with pinned, hashed dependencies.
        * Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `pip-audit`, GitHub Dependabot, or Snyk.
        * For shared libraries within the monorepo (like the `shared/` directory), versioning and release management should be considered if they evolve independently.

---

### 7. Secrets Management

* **Intended Secrets Management:**
    * The primary method for managing secrets (like `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `API_KEY`) appears to be through environment variables.
    * `.env.example` provides a template for these environment variables.
    * `scripts/docker-setup.sh` creates a `.env` file from `.env.example` if one doesn't exist.
    * Configuration files (`backend/app/config.py`, `frontend/app/config.py`) load these variables using `os.getenv()` or Pydantic's BaseSettings, which can read from `.env` files and environment variables.
    * `docker-compose.yml` references environment variables (e.g., `${GEMINI_API_KEY}`) which are typically sourced from a `.env` file in the same directory or passed directly into the container's environment.
* **Security Assessment of Principle:**
    * Using environment variables for secrets is a standard practice and is generally more secure than hardcoding them.
    * The key security aspect then becomes how these environment variables (and any `.env` files) are managed in different environments (development, staging, production).
    * **Production:** In production, environment variables should be injected securely into the container runtime environment (e.g., via Kubernetes secrets, Docker Swarm secrets, or platform-specific secret stores like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) rather than relying on `.env` files packaged with the application or present on the host filesystem if possible. The current setup using `docker-compose` implies it might load from a `.env` file on the host.
    * **Hardcoded Secrets:** As noted earlier, test keys are hardcoded in test files and CI config. This is an anti-pattern but less critical for test-only keys.
    * **`scripts/generate_api_key.py`:** This script uses `secrets.token_hex()`, which is a secure way to generate API keys. It also provides good security reminders.

### 8. Logging & Monitoring (Security Perspective)

* **Security-Relevant Events Logged:**
    * **Authentication:**
        * `backend/app/auth.py`: Logs a warning for invalid API key attempts: `logger.warning(f"Invalid API key attempted: {credentials.credentials[:8]}...")`.
        * It also logs when no API keys are configured (allowing unauthenticated access): `logger.warning("No API keys configured - allowing unauthenticated access")`.
        * Successful authentication is logged at debug level: `logger.debug("API key authentication successful")`.
    * **Access Control Failures:** These are typically raised as `HTTPException`s (e.g., 401, 403), and FastAPI's default logging or custom exception handlers would log these. The global exception handler in `backend/app/main.py` logs unhandled exceptions at `logger.error()`.
    * **Significant Errors:**
        * `backend/app/main.py`: The `global_exception_handler` logs unhandled exceptions: `logger.error(f"Unhandled exception: {str(exc)}")`.
        * `backend/app/services/text_processor.py`: Logs errors during text processing (e.g., `logger.error(f"Error processing text: {str(e)}")`, `logger.error(f"AI agent error...: {e}")`).
        * `backend/app/services/cache.py`: Logs Redis connection failures and cache operation errors (`logger.warning`).
        * `frontend/app/utils/api_client.py`: Logs API call failures (`logger.error`).
* **Sufficiency for Incident Investigation:**
    * **Strengths:** Basic error logging is present. Important events like invalid auth attempts and service errors are logged. The `AIServiceResilience` module also has logging for retries and circuit breaker state changes.
    * **Weaknesses:**
        * Lack of consistent structured logging (e.g., JSON format with predefined fields like `source_ip`, `user_id`/`api_key_id`, `event_type`, `outcome`). This makes automated analysis and correlation harder.
        * While invalid API key attempts are logged with a prefix, logging the source IP and targeted endpoint would be beneficial.
        * Successful authenticated requests could be logged with more detail (e.g., API key ID, endpoint accessed, processing time) at an INFO level for audit trails, if required. Currently, successful auth is DEBUG level.
        * No explicit logging of authorization decisions (though this is simple as it's just API key validity).
* **Sensitive Data in Logs:**
    * API key prefixes (`credentials.credentials[:8]...`) are logged for invalid attempts, which is a reasonable approach to avoid logging the full key.
    * The application seems to avoid logging full request/response bodies containing potentially sensitive user text by default, which is good. Error messages generally log the exception string, not raw input data.
