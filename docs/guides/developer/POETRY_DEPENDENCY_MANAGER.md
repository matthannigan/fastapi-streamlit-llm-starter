# Poetry Dependency Manager Guide

Poetry provides enhanced dependency management for **local development** in the FastAPI Streamlit LLM Starter template, while **Docker builds use pip** for simplified containerization. This hybrid approach combines Poetry's advanced dependency resolution with reliable Docker builds.

## 🚀 Quick Start: Hybrid Dependency Strategy

The template uses a **hybrid approach**:
- **Poetry**: Local development dependency management
- **pip**: Docker container builds with `requirements.docker.txt`
- **Unified Environment**: Single root virtual environment for development

### Setup (One-time)

```bash
# 1. Install Poetry (if not already installed)
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# 2. Set up Poetry development environment
make poetry-dev
```

### Adding New Dependencies

```bash
# 1. Use Poetry for enhanced dependency management
cd backend && poetry add pytest-mock

# 2. Update Docker requirements file manually (Docker uses pip)
# Edit backend/requirements.docker.txt to include new package

# 3. Install into unified root .venv for local development
make install
```

### Daily Development

```bash
# Local development with unified environment
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest backend/tests/
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
make test-backend
make lint-backend

# Docker development (uses pip automatically)
make dev                # Start Docker development environment
make backend-shell      # Access backend container
```

### Why This Hybrid Approach?

✅ **Poetry for Local Development**: Advanced dependency resolution, lock files, security scanning
✅ **pip for Docker**: Eliminates Poetry workspace complexity in containers
✅ **Unified Environment**: Single `.venv` at root - no environment switching
✅ **Reliable Docker Builds**: pip with `requirements.docker.txt` ensures consistent container builds
✅ **Simple Onboarding**: New developers just run `make install` or `make dev`
✅ **Best of Both Worlds**: Poetry's features locally, pip's reliability in containers

## Overview

This guide covers the **hybrid dependency management strategy** combining Poetry and pip:

### Poetry (Local Development)
- **Complex dependency resolution** with automatic conflict detection
- **Reproducible builds** with comprehensive lock files
- **Security scanning** and vulnerability detection
- **Modern Python packaging** standards
- **Advanced versioning** and constraint management

### pip (Docker Containers)
- **Simplified dependency installation** without workspace complexity
- **Reliable container builds** with `requirements.docker.txt`
- **Faster build times** and predictable behavior
- **Editable shared library installs** (`-e file:./shared`)

## Architecture

The template uses a **hybrid dependency management approach**:

```
fastapi-streamlit-llm-starter/
├── .venv/                      # Single root virtual environment (unified)
├── backend/
│   ├── Dockerfile              # Uses pip + requirements.docker.txt
│   ├── pyproject.toml          # Poetry for local dependency management
│   ├── poetry.lock             # Poetry dependency lock file
│   ├── requirements.docker.txt # Docker-specific pip requirements
│   ├── requirements-dev.txt    # Development dependencies
│   └── requirements-prod.txt   # Production dependencies
├── frontend/
│   ├── Dockerfile              # Uses pip + requirements.docker.txt
│   ├── pyproject.toml          # Poetry for local dependency management
│   └── requirements.docker.txt # Docker-specific pip requirements
├── shared/
│   ├── pyproject.toml          # setuptools configuration (not Poetry)
│   └── README.md               # Required for setuptools build
└── Makefile                    # Unified workflow commands
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Local Development**: Poetry for dependency management, root `.venv` for execution
- **Docker Builds**: pip with `requirements.docker.txt` for simplified containerization
- **Shared Library**: setuptools with automatic editable installs (`-e file:./shared`)
- **Unified Environment**: All local development tools use single root `.venv`
- **No Poetry in Docker**: Eliminates workspace dependency complexity in containers

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Poetry

```bash
# Install Poetry system-wide
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Add to PATH (follow installer instructions)
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Verify installation
poetry --version
```

### 2. Initialize Poetry Development Environment

```bash
# Set up Poetry environment with unified workflow
make poetry-dev
```

This command will:
- Install Poetry dependencies in backend
- Configure Poetry to work with root `.venv`
- Display the unified workflow instructions

## Development Workflow

### Adding Dependencies

```bash
# 1. Add dependency with Poetry (local development)
cd backend && poetry add fastapi-users
cd backend && poetry add "pydantic>=2.0,<3.0"  # With version constraints

# Development dependency
cd backend && poetry add --group dev pytest-mock
cd backend && poetry add --group test testcontainers

# 2. Update Docker requirements manually (required for Docker builds)
# Edit backend/requirements.docker.txt to include new packages:
# fastapi-users>=1.0.0
# pytest-mock>=3.10.0

# 3. Install into unified root .venv for local development
make install

# 4. Test Docker build works with new dependencies
make dev
```

### Managing Dependencies

```bash
# Update all dependencies (Poetry)
cd backend && poetry update

# Update specific dependency (Poetry)
cd backend && poetry update fastapi

# Show outdated dependencies (Poetry)
cd backend && poetry show --outdated

# Remove dependency
cd backend && poetry remove old-package
# Also remove from backend/requirements.docker.txt manually
make install  # Update unified environment
make dev      # Test Docker still works
```

### Environment Management

```bash
# Check Poetry environment info
cd backend && poetry env info

# Local development - unified environment (recommended)
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest backend/tests/
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Docker development - uses pip automatically
make dev                    # Start all services
make backend-shell          # Access backend container
make frontend-shell         # Access frontend container

# Run commands via Poetry (uses Poetry's environment)
cd backend && poetry run pytest tests/
cd backend && poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Advanced Features

### Security Scanning

```bash
# Security scanning across dependencies
make poetry-security-scan

# Full maintenance workflow with security updates
make poetry-maintenance
```

### Build and Export Operations

```bash
# Export dependencies to different formats
make poetry-export

# Manual export with specific options
cd backend && poetry export --without-hashes -f requirements.txt -o requirements.txt
cd backend && poetry export --without-hashes --with dev -f requirements.txt -o requirements-dev.txt
cd backend && poetry export --without-hashes --only main -f requirements.txt -o requirements-prod.txt

# Build wheel packages
cd backend && poetry build
```

### Dependency Analysis

```bash
# Show dependency tree
cd backend && poetry show --tree

# Show specific package info
cd backend && poetry show fastapi

# List all packages
cd backend && poetry show --no-dev  # Production only
cd backend && poetry show           # All packages
```

## Integration with Existing Workflows

### Makefile Commands

The template provides unified Makefile commands that work with both Poetry and pip workflows:

```bash
# Default workflow (works with or without Poetry)
make install              # Install using pip + requirements files
make test-backend         # Run backend tests
make lint-backend         # Run code quality checks
make run-backend          # Start development server

# Poetry-specific commands
make poetry-dev           # Set up Poetry development environment
make poetry-export        # Export Poetry dependencies to requirements files
make poetry-security-scan # Run security scanning
make poetry-maintenance   # Full maintenance workflow
```

### Docker Integration

**Docker builds now use pip directly, not Poetry**, for simplified dependency management:

```dockerfile
# Current Docker approach - uses pip with requirements.docker.txt
FROM python:3.13-slim AS dependencies

WORKDIR /app

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy shared directory first for shared library installation
COPY shared/ ./shared/

# Copy requirements for Docker build
COPY backend/requirements.docker.txt ./

# Install dependencies using pip (simpler than Poetry for Docker)
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.docker.txt
```

**Benefits of this approach:**
- ✅ Eliminates Poetry workspace dependency complexity in Docker
- ✅ Faster, more predictable builds
- ✅ Shared library automatically installed as editable package
- ✅ No Poetry lock file synchronization issues

### CI/CD Integration

Example GitHub Actions workflow with hybrid approach:

```yaml
name: Test with Hybrid Strategy

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test-local:
    name: Test Local Development (Poetry)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.13'

      - name: Install Poetry
        uses: snok/install-poetry@v1

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: make install

      - name: Run tests
        run: make test-backend

  test-docker:
    name: Test Docker Build (pip)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Test Docker build
        run: make dev

      - name: Run Docker tests
        run: make test
```

## Performance Comparison

Performance benchmarks for different dependency management approaches:

| Operation | pip-tools | Poetry (Local) | pip (Docker) | Best Choice |

**Hybrid Strategy Benefits:**
- **Local Development**: Poetry's advanced dependency resolution and security scanning
- **Docker Builds**: pip's speed and reliability without workspace complexity
- **Best Performance**: Choose the right tool for each environment

## Best Practices

### 1. Hybrid Dependency Management

**For Local Development (Poetry):**
```toml
[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
black = "^23.0.0"
isort = "^5.12.0"
mypy = "^1.0.0"

[tool.poetry.group.test.dependencies]
pytest = "^7.0.0"
pytest-asyncio = "^0.21.0"
testcontainers = "^4.0.0"

[tool.poetry.group.prod.dependencies]
gunicorn = "^21.0.0"
prometheus-client = "^0.16.0"
```

**For Docker (requirements.docker.txt):**
```txt
# Keep synchronized with Poetry dependencies
fastapi>=0.110.0
uvicorn[standard]>=0.35.0,<0.36.0
pydantic>=2.10
pytest>=8.0.0
pytest-asyncio>=0.23.0
-e file:./shared
```

### 2. Version Constraints

Use appropriate version constraints:

```bash
# Exact version (rare, for critical packages)
cd backend && poetry add "pydantic==2.11.9"

# Compatible release (recommended)
cd backend && poetry add "fastapi^0.110.0"  # >=0.110.0, <0.111.0

# Version range
cd backend && poetry add "httpx>=0.25.0,<0.30.0"

# Latest compatible
cd backend && poetry add "pytest^7.0"
```

### 3. Lock File Management

Keep lock files synchronized:

```bash
# Always commit lock files
git add backend/poetry.lock

# Regenerate after pyproject.toml changes
cd backend && poetry lock

# Update lock file without upgrading packages
cd backend && poetry lock --no-update
```

### 4. Security and Maintenance

Regular maintenance workflow for hybrid approach:

```bash
# Weekly security scan (Poetry)
make poetry-security-scan

# Monthly dependency updates
cd backend && poetry update
# Update Docker requirements manually to match
vim backend/requirements.docker.txt
make install  # Update local environment
make dev      # Test Docker build

# Quarterly full maintenance
make poetry-maintenance
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Poetry environment conflicts:**
```bash
# Reset Poetry environment
cd backend && poetry env remove --all
make poetry-dev
```

**Lock file conflicts during git merge:**
```bash
# Regenerate lock file
cd backend && rm poetry.lock
cd backend && poetry lock
make install
```

**Docker build fails with dependency issues:**
```bash
# Check Docker requirements are synchronized
cd backend && poetry show --only=main
# Manually update requirements.docker.txt to match
vim backend/requirements.docker.txt
make dev
```

**Dependencies not found in unified environment:**
```bash
# Ensure dependencies are properly installed
make install
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Shared library dependency issues in Docker:**
```bash
# Check shared library is properly structured
ls shared/pyproject.toml shared/README.md
# These files are required for pip editable install
```

### Performance Issues

**Slow dependency resolution:**
```bash
# Clear Poetry cache
poetry cache clear pypi --all

# Use faster resolver
poetry config experimental.new-installer false
```

**Large lock files:**
```bash
# Exclude unnecessary dependencies from lock file
cd backend && poetry export --without-hashes -f requirements.txt
```

## Migration Strategies

### From pip-tools to Poetry

For existing projects using pip-tools:

1. **Install Poetry**: `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -`
2. **Initialize**: `cd backend && poetry init`
3. **Import dependencies**: Convert requirements.txt to Poetry format
4. **Test**: `make poetry-dev`
5. **Export**: `make poetry-export && make install`
6. **Validate**: Run tests to ensure compatibility

### Rollback Strategy

Return to pip-only workflow if needed:

```bash
# Export current Poetry state to requirements files
make poetry-export

# Use traditional pip workflow
make clean-venv
make install
```

## Alternative Workflows

### Poetry for Dependency Management Only

Use Poetry for managing dependencies while using pip for installation:

```bash
# Manage dependencies with Poetry
cd backend && poetry add new-package
cd backend && poetry update

# Export and install with pip
make poetry-export
make install
```

### Hybrid Development

Different approaches for different scenarios:

```bash
# Quick development (unified environment)
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest backend/tests/

# Testing with exact Poetry environment
cd backend && poetry run pytest tests/

# Production builds (Docker with exported requirements)
make poetry-export
docker build -t app .
```

## Conclusion

The **hybrid dependency management strategy** in FastAPI Streamlit LLM Starter provides:

### Poetry (Local Development)
- **Enhanced dependency management** with automatic conflict resolution
- **Advanced security scanning** and vulnerability detection
- **Reproducible builds** through comprehensive lock files
- **Modern Python packaging** standards
- **Complex versioning** and constraint management

### pip (Docker Builds)
- **Simplified containerization** without Poetry workspace complexity
- **Faster build times** and predictable behavior
- **Reliable shared library installs** (`-e file:./shared`)
- **Consistent container builds** across environments

### Unified Benefits
- **Best of both worlds**: Poetry's features locally, pip's reliability in containers
- **Simplified onboarding**: Developers choose `make install` or `make dev`
- **Flexible development**: Use the right tool for each environment
- **Consistent experience**: Single `.venv` for all local development

### When to Use This Hybrid Approach

**Perfect for:**
- ✅ Projects requiring both advanced dependency management and reliable Docker builds
- ✅ Teams needing Poetry's security scanning with simple containerization
- ✅ Complex dependency resolution locally with fast Docker builds
- ✅ Modern development workflows with production-ready deployment

**Consider alternatives for:**
- ❌ Simple projects with minimal dependencies (pip-only might suffice)
- ❌ Docker-only development workflows (pip-only might be simpler)
- ❌ Legacy systems requiring specific dependency management approaches

The hybrid strategy eliminates the traditional trade-off between advanced dependency management and simple containerization, giving you the benefits of both approaches.

## Maintaining Synchronization

### Keeping Poetry and Docker Requirements in Sync

**Manual Synchronization Workflow:**
1. Add/update dependencies with Poetry
2. Manually update `requirements.docker.txt` files
3. Test both local and Docker environments
4. Commit both changes together

**Best Practices:**
```bash
# 1. Update with Poetry
cd backend && poetry add new-package>=1.0.0

# 2. Check current Poetry dependencies
cd backend && poetry show --only=main

# 3. Update Docker requirements to match
vim backend/requirements.docker.txt
# Add: new-package>=1.0.0

# 4. Test both environments
make install  # Test local
make dev      # Test Docker

# 5. Commit together
git add backend/pyproject.toml backend/poetry.lock backend/requirements.docker.txt
git commit -m "Add new-package dependency"
```

**Future Enhancement Ideas:**
- Automated synchronization scripts
- CI/CD validation of dependency alignment
- Tooling to compare Poetry exports with Docker requirements
