# Poetry Migration Guide

This guide provides comprehensive documentation for the Poetry migration completed in Phase 1-3 of the dependency management modernization project.

## Migration Summary

The FastAPI-Streamlit-LLM-Starter project has successfully migrated from traditional pip/requirements.txt dependency management to Poetry for improved dependency resolution, simplified Docker configuration, and enhanced developer experience.

### What Changed

**Before Migration:**
- Traditional pip + requirements.txt + pip-tools workflow
- Multiple requirements files per component (requirements.txt, requirements-dev.txt, requirements.lock, etc.)
- Complex Docker configuration with different dependency files
- Manual dependency conflict resolution
- Fragile shared library integration using editable installs

**After Migration:**
- Poetry-based dependency management with deterministic resolution
- Single `pyproject.toml` per component with dependency groups
- Simplified Docker configuration using Poetry export
- Automated dependency conflict resolution via Poetry's SAT solver
- Robust shared library integration using Poetry path dependencies

## New Developer Workflow

### Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   ```bash
   # Poetry should already be installed (completed in Phase 1)
   poetry --version  # Should show Poetry 2.1.4+
   ```

2. **Project Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Clone and setup project
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd fastapi-streamlit-llm-starter

   # Install all components using Makefile (recommended)
   make install

   # Or install components individually with Poetry
   cd backend && poetry install --with dev,test
   cd ../frontend && poetry install --with dev,test
   cd ../shared && poetry install --with dev
   ```

### Daily Development Commands

**Instead of pip/virtualenv commands, use:**

| Old Command | New Poetry Command | Purpose |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| `pip install package` | `poetry add package` | Add production dependency |
| `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` | `poetry install --with dev` | Install with dev dependencies |
| `pip install -e .` | `poetry install` | Install current project in development mode |
| `python script.py` | `poetry run python script.py` | Run script in Poetry environment |
| `pytest` | `poetry run pytest` | Run tests |
| `source venv/bin/activate` | `poetry shell` | Activate virtual environment |

**Component-Specific Commands:**

```bash
# Backend development
cd backend/
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload  # Start development server
poetry run pytest                         # Run tests
poetry run ruff check .                   # Lint code

# Frontend development
cd frontend/
poetry run streamlit run app/app.py       # Start Streamlit app
poetry run pytest                         # Run tests

# Shared library development
cd shared/
poetry build                              # Build package
poetry run pytest                         # Run tests (if any)
```

### Dependency Management

**Adding Dependencies:**

```bash
# Add production dependency
poetry add requests

# Add development dependency
poetry add --group dev pytest

# Add dependency to specific group
poetry add --group test pytest-cov

# Add local dependency (shared library)
poetry add --path ../shared
```

**Updating Dependencies:**

```bash
# Update all dependencies
poetry update

# Update specific dependency
poetry update requests

# Show dependency tree
poetry show --tree

# Show outdated packages
poetry show --outdated
```

### Virtual Environment Management

Poetry automatically manages virtual environments:

```bash
# Show virtual environment info
poetry env info

# Activate shell (alternative to source activate)
poetry shell

# Run command in environment
poetry run python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"

# Remove virtual environment
poetry env remove python
```

## Migration Changes by Component

### Backend (`backend/`)

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Migrated from `requirements.txt` to `pyproject.toml` with Poetry format
- ✅ Organized dependencies into groups: main, dev, test, prod
- ✅ Configured shared library as path dependency: `poetry add --path ../shared`
- ✅ Updated Docker configuration to use Poetry export for production builds
- ✅ All infrastructure services (cache, resilience, security, monitoring) fully compatible

**pyproject.toml Structure:**
```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "fastapi-backend"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Production-ready FastAPI backend with comprehensive infrastructure"

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.12"
fastapi = "^0.110.0"
uvicorn = {extras = ["standard"], version = "^0.35.0"}
my-project-shared-lib = {path = "../shared", develop = true}
# ... other dependencies

[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
pytest = "^8.0.0"
pytest-asyncio = "^0.23.0"
ruff = "^0.7.4"
mypy = "^1.18.0"
# ... other dev dependencies

[tool.poetry.group.test.dependencies]
pytest-cov = "^4.0"
pytest-xdist = "^3.7.0"
httpx = "^0.28.1"
fakeredis = "^2.10.0"
# ... other test dependencies
```

### Frontend (`frontend/`)

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Migrated from `requirements.txt` to Poetry format
- ✅ Organized dependencies for Streamlit application needs
- ✅ Configured shared library integration
- ✅ Updated Docker configuration for Poetry-based builds

**Streamlit Development:**
```bash
cd frontend/
poetry install --with dev,test,ui    # Install all dependency groups
poetry run streamlit run app/app.py  # Start development server
```

### Shared Library (`shared/`)

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Converted from PEP 621 format to Poetry format
- ✅ Set up proper Poetry package configuration
- ✅ Maintained Python 3.12+ requirement
- ✅ Configured as installable package for backend/frontend

**Integration:**
- Backend and frontend reference shared library using: `my-project-shared-lib = {path = "../shared", develop = true}`
- Changes in shared library automatically available in dependent components

## Docker Integration

### Production Builds

Poetry export is used for optimized production builds:

```dockerfile
# Backend Dockerfile example
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
RUN poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Available Export Commands:**
```bash
# Export production dependencies only
poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.txt

# Export with development dependencies
poetry export -f requirements.txt --with dev --output requirements-dev.txt

# Export with specific groups
poetry export -f requirements.txt --with test --output requirements-test.txt
```

### Development Builds

Development Docker images use Poetry directly:

```dockerfile
# Development stage
RUN pip install poetry==2.1.4
COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
RUN poetry install --with dev
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

Poetry is integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml example
- name: Install Poetry
  run: pip install poetry==2.1.4

- name: Install dependencies
  run: poetry install --with dev,test

- name: Run tests
  run: poetry run pytest
```

### Makefile Integration

The existing Makefile has been updated to support Poetry:

```makefile
# Root Makefile targets
install: poetry-install        # Install all components with Poetry
test-backend:
	cd backend && poetry run pytest
test-frontend:
	cd frontend && poetry run pytest

poetry-install:
	cd backend && poetry install --with dev,test
	cd frontend && poetry install --with dev,test
	cd shared && poetry install --with dev
```

## Performance & Security

### Performance Improvements

**Benchmark Results:**
- **Poetry install time**: ~0.665 seconds (backend)
- **Poetry export time**: ~0.323 seconds (production requirements)
- **Dependency resolution**: Significantly faster with fewer conflicts

**Build Time Optimization:**
- Docker layer caching optimized with Poetry lock files
- Multi-stage builds use Poetry export for minimal production images
- Shared library integration eliminates build complexity

### Security Features

**Automated Security Scanning:**
```bash
# Use the provided maintenance script
.venv/bin/python scripts/poetry_maintenance.py security-scan

# Manual security audit (requires pip-audit)
poetry export -f requirements.txt | pip-audit -r -
```

**Dependency Security:**
- Poetry lock files ensure reproducible builds
- Hash verification for all dependencies
- Automated vulnerability scanning integrated

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Poetry not found" Error:**
```bash
# Verify Poetry installation
poetry --version

# If not found, add to PATH or reinstall
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

**2. Virtual Environment Issues:**
```bash
# Reset virtual environment
poetry env remove python
poetry install

# Use system Python if needed
poetry env use python3.12
```

**3. Dependency Conflicts:**
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
poetry cache clear pypi --all
poetry install

# Force update lock file
poetry lock --no-update
```

**4. Shared Library Import Issues:**
```bash
# Reinstall shared library dependency
cd backend/  # or frontend/
poetry remove my-project-shared-lib
poetry add --path ../shared
```

**5. Docker Build Issues:**
```bash
# Verify Poetry export works
poetry export -f requirements.txt --output /tmp/test-requirements.txt
cat /tmp/test-requirements.txt | head -10

# Test exported requirements
pip install -r /tmp/test-requirements.txt
```

### IDE Integration

**VS Code:**
1. Install Python extension
2. Select Poetry virtual environment: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Python: Select Interpreter"
3. Choose the Poetry environment (usually in `~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/`)
