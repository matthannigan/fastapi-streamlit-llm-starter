## Priority Classification

### High Priority (Create First)

1. `docs/tutorials/QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` - First user experience and guided onboarding
2. `docs/operations/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Critical for deployment with production-specific considerations
3. `docs/operations/TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md` - Centralized support for common issues and solutions
4. `docs/security/CONSOLIDATED_SECURITY_GUIDE.md` - Unified security best practices across all components

### Medium Priority

5. `docs/infrastructure/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md` - System tuning and optimization strategies
6. `docs/development/INFRASTRUCTURE_DEVELOPMENT.md` - Developer guidance for extending infrastructure
7. `docs/tutorials/ADVANCED_CONFIGURATION.md` - Deep dive into resilience and configuration management
8. `docs/operations/MONITORING_AND_ALERTING.md` - Operational monitoring setup and alerting

### Lower Priority (Enhancement)

9. Tutorial series completion (beginner to advanced progression)
10. Advanced examples and integration patterns
11. Frontend architecture deep dives
12. Template contribution and community guides

## Key Gaps Identified (Revised After Review)

1. **Missing operational guidance** - No comprehensive production deployment and operations documentation
2. **Lack of tutorial progression** - No guided learning path from beginner to advanced usage
3. **Scattered troubleshooting information** - No centralized troubleshooting and problem-solving guide
4. **Security documentation fragmentation** - Security practices spread across infrastructure components need consolidation
5. **Performance optimization guidance missing** - No comprehensive performance tuning documentation
6. **Template usage patterns unclear** - Limited guidance on what to keep/replace when customizing template

## Immediate Opportunities (Based on Documentation Review)

### Quick Wins (Low Effort, High Impact)

1. **Cross-Reference Links**: Add navigation links between related documentation sections
   - Link from quick-guides to deeper developer-guide content
   - Connect infrastructure guides to related API endpoints
   - Reference CLAUDE.md guidance from relevant sections

2. **Documentation Index**: Create a master index in `docs/README.md` with:
   - Documentation map by user type (new user, developer, operator)
   - Quick access to most-requested documentation
   - Migration guide from older documentation structure

3. **Examples Enhancement**: Expand `examples/README.md` with:
   - Real-world usage scenarios
   - Common integration patterns
   - Performance benchmarking examples

### Medium Effort Enhancements

4. **Operational Runbooks**: Document standard operational procedures:
   - Health check procedures
   - Common troubleshooting workflows
   - Performance monitoring setup
   - Backup and recovery procedures

5. **Security Consolidation**: Create unified security documentation:
   - Consolidate security practices from infrastructure READMEs
   - Production security checklist
   - Security incident response procedures

6. **Tutorial Progression**: Develop learning path documentation:
   - 15-minute quick start
   - Complete setup tutorial
   - Advanced customization guide
   - Production deployment walkthrough

## Documentation Quality Improvements

### Navigation and Discoverability

- Add "Related Documentation" sections to each guide
- Implement consistent cross-referencing format
- Create topic-based navigation in addition to structure-based

### Content Standardization

- Ensure consistent format across all infrastructure READMEs
- Standardize code example formatting
- Implement consistent terminology throughout documentation

### User Journey Optimization

- Map documentation to specific user personas (new developer, ops engineer, security reviewer)
- Create documentation paths for common use cases
- Add "What's Next" sections to guide users through logical progressions
